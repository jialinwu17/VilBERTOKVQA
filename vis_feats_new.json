shoe developed for track running.<br/>The term 'athletic shoes' is typically used for shoes utilized for jogging or road running and indoor sports such as basketball, but tends to exclude shoes for sports played on grass such as association football and rugby football, which are generally known in North America as \"cleats\" and in British English as \"boots\" or \"studs\".<br/><br/>white shoe:

rails used in the Strub system became unavailable.<br/>It uses a ladder rack, formed of steel plates or channels connected by round or square rods at regular intervals.<br/>The Abt system is cheaper to build than the Riggenbach because it requires a lower weight of rack over a given length.<br/>The Strub rack system was invented by Emil Strub in 1896.<br/>The Fell mountain railway system, developed in the 1860s, is not strictly speaking a rack railway, since there are no cogs with teeth.<br/>The Riggenbach system is similar in design to the Marsh system.<br/>The Lamella rack can be used by locomotives designed for use on the Riggenbach or the Strub systems, so long as the safety-jaws that were a feature of the original Strub system are not used.<br/>The Morgan rack was good for

go outside or should their heating fail.<br/>Minnesota experienced a rare May snowstorm as a result of this cold wave.<br/>Globally, more people die during hot weather than cold weather.<br/>Some places like Germany, France, Italy, Romania and Spain had record cold temperatures well below 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F).<br/>Fires become even more of a hazard during extreme cold.<br/>Some may even choose to migrate to places of milder climates, at least during the winter.<br/>Both cold waves and heat waves cause deaths, though different groups of people may be susceptible to different weather events.<br/>A cold wave can cause death and injury to livestock and wildlife.<br/>Extreme winter cold often causes poorly insulated water pipelines and mains to freeze.<br/>In some places, such as Siberia, extreme cold requires that fuel-powered machinery to be used even part-time must be run continuously.<br/><br/>cloth: Animal textiles are commonly made from hair, fur, skin or silk (in the case of silkworms).<br/>Some weaving is still done by hand, but the vast majority is mechanized.<br/>The cloth was most likely made by the native Asia people of northwest Romblon.<br/>Textiles are

manufacturing techniques.<br/>Cotton, flax, jute, hemp, modal and even banana and bamboo fibre are all used in clothing.<br/>Due to the often highly technical and legal requirements of these products, these textiles are typically tested in order to ensure they meet stringent performance requirements.<br/>Polyester fibre is used in all types of clothing, either alone or blended with fibres such as cotton.<br/>Straw and bamboo are both used to make hats.<br/>Different types of rayon can imitate the feel and texture of silk, cotton, wool, or linen.<br/><br/>sport: Sport betting is in some cases severely regulated, and in some cases is central to the sport.<br/>These trends are seen by many as contrary to the fundamental ethos of sport being carried on for its own sake and for the enjoyment of its participants.<br/>Germany used the Olympics to give off a peaceful image while secretly preparing for war.<br/>Other organisations, such as the Council of Europe, preclude activities without a physical element from classification as sports.<br/>Some sports also use it to allow off-field decision making.<br/>Nationalism is often evident in the pursuit of sport, or in its reporting: people compete in national teams, or commentators and audiences can adopt a partisan view.<br/>The competitive nature of sport encourages some participants to attempt to enhance their performance through the use of medicines, or through other means such as increasing the volume of blood in their bodies through artificial means.<br/>Other bodies advocate widening the definition of sport to include all physical activity.<br/>The practice of athletic competitions has been criticised by some Christian thinkers as a form of idolatry, in which \"human beings extol themselves, adore themselves, sacrifice

because it has no atmosphere to trap in heat from the Sun.<br/>Soviet investment in the defense sector was not driven by military necessity, but in large part by the interests of massive party and state bureaucracies dependent on the sector for their own power and privileges.<br/>Soviet radio broadcasts used Marxist rhetoric to attack capitalism, emphasizing themes of labor exploitation,

quicker than the ordinary water.<br/>Shivering is one of the first physiological responses to cold.<br/>Local frostbite leads to so-called chilblains or even to the death of entire body parts.<br/><br/>stay warm: Heating is expensive because of the lack of insulation and the draftiness of housing.<br/>This kotatsu came about with the popular use of tatami matting in Japanese homes.<br/>A kotatsu is a relatively inexpensive way to stay warm in the winter, as the futons trap the warm air.<br/>Families may choose to concentrate their activity in this one area of the house in order to save on energy costs.<br/>Most Japanese housing is not insulated to the same degree as a Western domicile and does not have central heating, thus relying primarily on space heating.<br/>The kotatsu was designed when people most commonly wore traditional Japanese style clothes, where the heat would enter through the bottom of the robes and rise to exit around the neck, thus heating the entire body.<br/>Traditionally, children are told that they will catch a cold if they sleep under a kotatsu.<br/>Thus, the kotatsu became completely mobile with electricity and became a common feature of Japanese homes during winter.<br/>The kotatsu usually is set on a thin futon, like a throw rug.<br/>During the winter months in Japan, the kotatsu often is the center of domestic life.<br/><br/>man: In all cultures in the past, and still among traditional and non-Western cultures, getting married is the most common and definitive distinction between boyhood and manhood.<br/>In Western culture, for example, greater masculinity usually brings greater social status.<br/>While the majority of men are heterosexual, significant minorities are homosexual or bisexual.<br/>Although in general men suffer from many of the same illnesses as women, they suffer from slightly more illnesses in comparison to women.<br/>Secondary sexual characteristics that are specific to men

left.<br/>West is the direction opposite that of the Earth's rotation on its axis, and is therefore the general direction towards which the Sun appears to constantly progress and eventually set.<br/>To an observer on the surface of Venus, the Sun would rise in the west and set in the east although Venus's opaque clouds prevent observing the Sun from the planet's surface.<br/>According to the Bible, the Israelites crossed the Jordan River westward into the Promised Land.<br/>All demons are part of the East.<br/>This is not true on the planet Venus, which rotates in the opposite direction from the Earth (retrograde rotation).<br/>In Saberhagen's Empire of the East series, the rival powers are West and East, including both humans and supernatural beings.<br/>In Tolkien's earlier work, the north had been the direction of evil.<br/>Ancient Egyptians also believed that the Goddess Amunet was a personification of the West.<br/>The concept of the Western part of the earth has its roots in the Western Roman Empire and the Western Christianity.<br/><br/>direction should the object: For example, an object to the East would have an absolute bearing of 90 degrees.<br/>For example, an object relative bearing of 0 degrees would be dead ahead.<br/>an object relative bearing 180 degrees would be behind.<br/>A bearing can be taken to a fixed or moving object in order to target it with gunfire or missiles.<br/>Accordingly, the direction at A of B, expressed as a bearing, is not in general the opposite of the direction at B of A (when traveling on the great circle formed by A and B).<br/>Example: The navigator on a ship observes a lighthouse when its relative bearing is 45\u00b0 and again when it is 90\u00b0.<br/>25\u00b0 relative would be 'one point abaft the starboard beam' and an object at 213.<br/>Relative bearing refers to the angle between the craft's forward direction and the location of another object.<br/>See the end point on a map when you specify a start point, a bearing and a distance.<br/>He now knows that the distance from the ship to the lighthouse is equal to the distance travelled by the vessel between both observations.<br/><br/>ceiling fan: Also, if one is carrying a long and awkward object, one end may inadvertently enter the path of rotation of a ceiling fan's blades, which can cause damage to the fan.<br/>A downrod, a metal pipe used to suspend the fan from the ceiling.<br/>A mechanism for mounting the fan to the ceiling such as:.<br/>A type of mounting system where the ceiling fan hangs on a hardened metal hook, screwed into the ceiling or bolted through a steel I-beam.<br/>This action works to even out the temperature in the room, making it cooler nearer the ceiling, but warmer nearer the floor.<br/>The direction that a fan spins should change based on whether the room needs to be heated or cooled.<br/>Contrary to popular misconception, wobbling alone will not cause a ceiling fan to fall.<br/>Some fans have their control(s) mounted on the wall instead of on the fans themselves.<br/>The fan can be mounted directly on a ceiling hook, making the junction box optional.<br/>In one position, the fan is caused to rotate clockwise, in the other position the fan is caused to rotate counter-clockwise.<br/><br/>overhead: Normally the downward pull of the weights and the reactive upward pull of the tensioned wires lifts the pulley so its teeth are well clear of a stop on the mast.<br/>The pulley can turn freely while the weights move up or down as the wires contract or expand.<br/>With AT the continuous length of overhead line is limited due to the change in the height of the weights as the overhead line expands and contracts with temperature changes.<br/>As the pantograph moves along under the contact wire, the carbon insert on top of the pantograph becomes worn with time.<br/>It presses against the underside of the lowest overhead wire, the contact wire.<br/>This stops further rotation, limits the damage, and keeps the undamaged part of the wire intact until it can be repaired.<br/>This can result in poor electrical contact between the collector and the overhead line, resulting in electrical arcing and power surges.<br/>Problems with overhead equipment.<br/>Alternatively, section breaks can be sited at the crossing point, so that the crossing is electrically dead.<br/>To make the wire stronger, 0.<br/><br/>chair: Hence in some chair designs, the armrest is not continuous to the chair back, but is missing in the elbow area.<br/>otherwise the occupant is too far away from the desk or

pages with titles containing the chair.<br/>Chair glides are attached to the feet of chairs to prevent them from scratching or snagging on the floor.<br/>This anthropometric measurement is used to determine the seat depth.<br/>By matching the shape of the occupant's buttocks, weight is distributed and maximum pressure is reduced.<br/>However, the person who is first chair in the first violin

the object: Thus, the objects can be receivers of both love and hate, the affective effects of the libido and the death drive.<br/>Likewise, the infant who destroyed the bad object is not the infant who loves the good object.<br/>The introjection of the good object, first of all the mother\u2019s breast, is a precondition for normal development.<br/>In Kashmiri, the word order in embedded clauses is conditioned by the category of the subordinating conjunction, as in Example 3.<br/>Part objects are a function of splitting, which takes place in phantasy.<br/>Introjection of the good object is also used by the ego as a defense against anxiety.<br/>Internal objects are formed by the patterns in one's experience of being taken care of as a baby, which may or may not be accurate representations of the actual, external caretakers.<br/>Klein notes that in splitting the object, the ego is also split.<br/>\u201cBefore the depressive position, a good object is not in any way the same thing as a bad object.<br/>Freud originally identified people in a subject's environment with the term \"object\" to identify people as the object of drives.<br/><br/>furniture: Methods for determination of stability of non-domestic storage furniture (British Standard).<br/>The geometric rosette accompanies the ogive many times, having a big variety of forms.<br/>Usually, the locks and escutcheon of chests have also an ornamental scope, being finely made.<br/>Strength and stability of furniture.<br/>It is likely that the style of furniture prevalent in late antiquity persisted throughout the middle ages.<br/>This will be evident to anyone who will visit, first the Palace of Versailles, then the Grand Trianon, and afterwards the Petit Trianon.<br/>He discovered the benefits of a waterbed for recuperation.<br/>The practice of using natural objects as rudimentary pieces of furniture likely dates to the beginning of human civilisation.<br/>The English usage, referring specifically to household objects, is specific to that language.<br/>Casters which make some furniture moveable.<br/><br/>carpet: In fact, the circumstance in which the substance is viewed by the camera is still ambiguous.<br/>The exact nature of the substance that is deposited on Michael's carpet is never made clear.<br/>This happened when the fibres degraded over time and short strands broke away with contact or friction.<br/>Until the mid-18th century they were mostly used on walls and tables.<br/>With judicial and skilful planting of colours in the frames the number of colours could be increased to about twenty, enabling complex designs to be produced.<br/>The carpet is produced on a loom quite similar to woven fabric.<br/>There are new styles of carpet combining the two styles called cut and loop carpeting.<br/>Still, some show figures engaged either in the hunt or feasting scenes.<br/>Except in royal or ecclesiastical settings they were considered too precious to cover the floor.<br/>Historically, the term \"carpet\" was also applied to table and wall coverings, as carpets were not commonly used on the floor in European interiors until the 15th century.<br/><br/>north: This means some objects, such as Uranus, rotate in the retrograde direction: when seen from the IAU north, the spin is clockwise.<br/>The visible rotation of the night sky around the visible celestial pole provides a vivid metaphor of that direction corresponding to \"up\".<br/>On any rotating astronomical object, north often denotes the side appearing to rotate counter-clockwise when viewed from afar along the axis of rotation.<br/>By convention, the top side of a map is often north.<br/>Similarly, the other cardinal directions are also related to the sun's position.<br/>The area Sektion 12 on the lower \"B-stand\" grew so popular that the fans in a dialogue with the club made it bigger.<br/>east and west would not be 180 degrees apart, but instead would differ from that by up to twice the degrees of latitude of the location in question, and.<br/>Maps tend to be drawn for viewing with either true north or magnetic north at the top.<br/>occasionally with a single arrow oriented to the map's representation of magnetic north, or two arrows oriented to true and magnetic north respectively,.<br/>usually with a single arrow oriented to the map's representation of true north,.<br/><br/>clockwise: Then, when the Sun moves in the sky (from east to south to west), the shadow, which is cast on the sundial in the opposite direction, moves with the same sense of rotation (from west to north to east).<br/>Similarly, the flyer whorl of a spinning wheel uses a left-hand thread to keep it from loosening.<br/>This effect is caused by the plane of the dial having been rotated through the plane of the motion of the sun and thus the shadow is observed from the other side of the dial's plane and is observed as moving in the opposite direction.<br/>Curiously, unlike with games, there is usually no objection when the activity uncharacteristically begins in a counterclockwise motion.<br/>Typical nuts, screws, bolts, bottle caps, and jar lids are tightened (moved away from the observer) clockwise and loosened (moved towards the observer) counterclockwise in accordance with the right-hand rule.<br/>Two-dimensional rotation can occur in two possible directions.<br/>For bicycle pedals, the one on the left must be reverse-threaded to prevent it unscrewing during use.<br/>To apply the right-hand rule, place one's loosely clenched right hand above the object with the thumb pointing in the direction one wants the screw, nut, bolt, or cap ultimately to move, and the curl of the fingers, from the palm to the tips, will indicate in which way one needs to turn the screw, nut, bolt or cap to achieve the desired result.<br/>A turnbuckle has right-handed threads on one end and left-handed threads on the other.<br/>An alternative formulation with sin and cos swapped gives a clockwise trace from the upper-most point.<br/><br/>pillow: With a hemstitched or corded decoration around the inner edge of the valance.<br/>The appropriate size of a bed pillow depends on the size of the bed.<br/>However, U-shaped pillows can sometimes force the head forward, creating neck stiffness.<br/>Travel pillows provide support for the neck in a sitting position.<br/>The main distinguishing feature is whether the pillow case is plain or with a valance around the edge.<br/>Often, a zippered pillow protector is often placed around standard pillows with the case in turn covering the protector.<br/>For example, unless a person has some particular medical condition, they will likely use a handy decorative pillow for lumbar support, as needed, while seated on a sofa.<br/>essentially a bag, with a flap in the open end to tuck the pillowcase behind to keep it in.<br/>This pillows have a separate flap of fabric that is attached at the top of the pillow and folds down over the face.<br/>In earlier eras, pillows would often break, shedding feathers throughout a room.<br/><br/>south: This illustrates the effect the Allardyce Range has in breaking up cloud cover.<br/>A series of six passages separates each of the islands or island groups in the chain.<br/>Conversely, the highest recorded temperature at Bird Island on the windward

Therefore, it is necessary for the blade to be twisted so as to maintain a uniform angle of attack over the whole of the blade.<br/>Generally, the propellers on both engines of most conventional twin-engined aircraft spin clockwise (as viewed from the rear of the aircraft).<br/>Often, the bushing can be drawn into place with nothing more complex than a couple of nuts, washers and a threaded rod.<br/>The force felt by the blades acting to pull them away from the hub when turning.<br/>instead they may fit a rope cutter that fits around the prop shaft and rotates with the propeller.<br/>Also, the rubber bushing may perish over time leading to its failure under loads below its designed failure load.<br/>However, 'lift-and-drag' is only one way to express the aerodynamic force on the blades.<br/>The pressure on the upstream surface of the blade (the \"suction side\") can drop below the vapor pressure of the water, resulting in the formation of a vapor pocket.<br/>The transverse view shows the transverse projection of a blade and the developed outline of the blade.<br/>Forces acting on a propeller.<br/><br/>overhead should the object: Due to the mirroring of the

shallow copy gives in that the objects referenced by the copy B are distinct from those referenced by A, and independent.<br/>However, because the lamp was suspended above and outside the reflector, a large amount of light was cast to the sides inside the projector body that was wasted, thus requiring a higher power lamp for sufficient screen illumination.<br/>This has the greatest effect towards the outer edges of the projected image, so that one typically sees either blue or brown fringing at the edge of the screen when the focus is towards an extreme.<br/>With a change in the projection distance, the focusing must be readjusted for a sharp image.<br/>Next, it is reflected horizontally to the screen.<br/>This, coupled with a wide angle lens and an overhead reflector, directs the light

inside the waveguide change the characteristic impedance and frequency, degrading the signal.<br/>The differences in particle size dictate if the silica gel should be used for flash or gravity chromatography.<br/>Additionally, the gel acts as a processing aid when the cable is being constructed, keeping the fibers central whilst the tube material is extruded around it.<br/>However, material silica gel removes moisture by adsorption onto the surface of its numerous pores rather than by absorption into the bulk of the gel.<br/>Once saturated with water, the gel can be regenerated by heating it to 120 \u00b0C (250 \u00b0F) for 1\u20132 hours.<br/>It is common for a small compressed air system (similar to a small home aquarium pump) to be employed to circulate the air inside the waveguide over a jar of silica gel.<br/>Note 1: The network component of a hydrogel is usually a polymer network.<br/>Because of the inherent cross-links, the structural integrity of the hydrogel

but is now a metonym for the phenomenon as a whole.<br/>Although a couch is used primarily for seating, it may be used for sleeping.<br/>Sectional sofas are used to wrap around walls or other furniture.<br/>It is commonly found in the form of a bench, with upholstered armrests, and often fitted with springs and tailored cushions.<br/>The loveseat is designed for seating two people, while the sofa has more than two cushion seats.<br/>Couch is predominantly used in North America, South Africa, Australia and Ireland, whereas the terms sofa and settee (U and non-U) are most commonly used in the United Kingdom and India.<br/>An actor's decision of whether to provide sex is comparable to the prisoner's dilemma, and results in a tragedy of the commons in which sex is needed to obtain

mechanism for mounting the fan to the ceiling such as:.<br/>A type of mounting system where the ceiling fan hangs on a hardened metal hook, screwed into the ceiling or bolted through a steel I-beam.<br/>This action works to even out the temperature in the room, making it cooler nearer the ceiling, but warmer nearer the floor.<br/>The direction that a fan spins should change based on whether the room needs to be heated or cooled.<br/>Contrary to popular misconception, wobbling alone will not cause a ceiling fan to fall.<br/>Some fans have their control(s) mounted on the wall

highways were constructed during the 19th century with macadam.<br/>The first forms of road transport involved animals, such as horses (domesticated in the 4th or the 3rd millennium BCE), oxen (from about 8000 BCE).<br/>Another style of unit train is a local trash train, D765, that runs between the Maryland towns of Derwood and Dickerson.<br/>The Industrial Revolution in the 19th century saw a number of inventions fundamentally change transport.<br/>Early water transport was accomplished with ships that were either rowed or used the wind for propulsion, or a combination of the two.<br/>In the 1950s the introduction of containerization gave massive efficiency gains in freight transport, fostering globalization.<br/>Most such transport infrastructure came under government control in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, culminating in the nationalization of inter-city passenger rail-service with the establishment of Amtrak.<br/>While all modes of transport are used for cargo transport, there is high differentiation between the nature of the cargo transport, in which mode is chosen.<br/>Another group of projects are the \"heavy\" units.<br/>The 19th century also saw the development of the steam ship, which sped up global transport.<br/><br/>1800's: The man behind the project was an engineering consultant to Volvo, Helmer Petterson, who in the 1940s was responsible for the Volvo PV444.<br/>In 1972, to meet emission standards mainly for the US market, a lower compression B20F engine was introduced for specific markets.<br/>Two overdrive types were used, the

railways, rubber-tired underground, funicular and cog railways.<br/>An alternative type of \"intermodal\" vehicle, known as a roadrailer, is designed to be physically attached to the train.<br/>One notable and growing long-distance train category is high-speed rail, which generally runs at speeds above 200 km/h (120 mph) and often operates on dedicated track that is surveyed and prepared to accommodate high speeds.<br/>Trains are a very efficient mode of transport to cope with large traffic demand in a metropolis.<br/>There are various types of trains that are designed for particular purposes.<br/>There are simple types of open-topped wagons for transporting minerals and bulk material such as coal, and tankers for transporting liquids and gases.<br/>A developing technology is fuel cells, which combine the advantage of not needing an electrical system in place, with the advantage of emissionless operation.<br/>The first successful example of a high-speed passenger rail system was Japan's Shinkansen, colloquially known as the \"bullet train\", which commenced operation in October 1964.<br/>One of the most common types on modern railways are intermodal (container) trains, where the containers can be lifted on and off the train by cranes and loaded off or onto trucks or ships.<br/>An early prototype was demonstrated in 1913.<br/><br/>1800's transportation: Nicolas

in a gasoline engine, so its low octane rating is not an issue.<br/><br/>diesel source: diesel engines are simply compression-ignition engines, and can operate on a variety of different fuels, depending on configuration and location.<br/>A diesel compression-ignition engine is usually designed to run on diesel fuel, but some types are adapted for other liquid fuels or natural gas.<br/>Diesel engines can work with the full spectrum of crude oil distillates, from natural gas, alcohols, gasoline, wood gas to the fuel oils from diesel oil to cheaper residual fuels that are like lard at room temperature, and must be heated to enable them to flow down a fuel line.<br/>The total capacity of reliably operable standby generation in Britain is estimated to be around 20 GW, nearly all of which is driven by diesel engines.<br/>Larger engines (from about 3 MWe to 30 MWe) sometimes use heavy oils, essentially tars, derived from the end of the refining process.<br/>This is implemented by introducing gas with the intake air and using a small amount of diesel fuel for ignition.<br/>In more rural situations, or for low load factor plant, diesel fuel derived from crude oil is a common fuel.<br/>Such a diesel-electric arrangement is also used in some very large land vehicles such as railroad locomotives.<br/>A diesel generator will take more load when the fuel supply to

create up to 50,000 shaft horsepower.<br/>The compressor is powered by the turbine, which extracts energy from the expanding gas passing through it.<br/>A few air-breathing engines made for high speed applications (ramjets and scramjets) use the ram effect of the vehicle's speed instead of a mechanical compressor.<br/>Most modern subsonic jet aircraft use more complex high-bypass turbofan engines.<br/>Jet aircraft use such engines for long-distance travel.<br/>There are many different variations of gas turbines, but they all use a gas generator system of some type.<br/>As a result, a

formation is used.<br/>Many prestigious passenger train services have been bestowed a special name, some of which have become famous in literature and fiction.<br/>A less common practice is the naming of freight trains, for the same commercial reasons.<br/><br/>transport: Also, a train can be powered by horses, cables, gravity, pneumatics and gas turbines.<br/>Some long-haul trains have been given a specific name.<br/>A multiple unit has powered wheels throughout the whole train.<br/>The inspection of railway equipment is essential for the safe movement of trains.<br/>Following his patent, Watt's employee William Murdoch produced a working model of a self-propelled steam carriage in that year.<br/>Many types of defect detectors are in use on the world's railroads.<br/>Most forms of train control involve movement authority being passed from those responsible for each section of a rail network to the train crew.<br/>Thus the railway system in Great Britain is the oldest in the world.<br/>Freight trains are very efficient, with economy of scale and high energy efficiency.<br/>Passenger trains.<br/><br/>atl\u00e9tico nacional: The colors of the team are derived from the flags of the Antioquia Department and the city of Medell\u00edn.<br/>The club was created to promote sports in the city, especially football and basketball.<br/>The involvement of Pablo Escobar in the club remained strong.<br/>The stadium is shared with Independiente Medell\u00edn, rival of the team.<br/>The first match was played in Curitiba.<br/>People saw our situation and said Pablo was involved.<br/>However, the team had to play its home matches in Chile.<br/>Evolution of Atl\u00e9tico Nacional's badge.<br/>Currently both teams are considered among the top teams in Colombia.<br/>the white variety is the most common in the region, giving the color scheme to the team.<br/><br/>electric locomotive: The first electric passenger train was presented by Werner von Siemens at Berlin in 1879.<br/>the failure of this single unit temporarily disables the train.<br/>The upper half depicts the ES 64 U \"Taurus\", a high performance locomotive from the turn of the 21st century.<br/>Also, the latest Russian passenger locomotive EP10 is dual-system.<br/>Maximum utilization of power cars.<br/>The distinguishing design features of electric locomotives are:.<br/>The type of service in which the locomotive is used dictates the gear ratio employed.<br/>The type of electrical power used, AC or DC.<br/>The obverse shows two locomotives: one historic and one modern, representing the technical development in locomotive construction between the years 1854 and 2004.<br/>One example is the 25 Euro 150 Years Semmering Alpine Railway commemorative coin.<br/><br/>subway: is the owner of

Subway announced a new logo for the franchise, to be implemented in 2017.<br/>All pages with titles containing Subway.<br/>Subway responded by saying, \"With regards to the size of the bread and calling it a footlong, 'Subway Footlong' is a registered trademark as a descriptive name for the sub sold in Subway Restaurants and not intended to be a measurement of length.<br/>to oversee operations of the restaurants as the franchise expanded.<br/>Subway made alterations to its bread after food blogger and activist Vani Hari gathered more than 50,000 signatures in a petition drive.<br/><br/>longcroft school: The facilities available at the school are used by many community groups and organisations during evenings, at weekends and during school holidays.<br/>Over the choir's period of existence, the choir has performed at venues such as Disneyland Paris and the Apple Store on Oxford Street, London, have released two of their own albums and have featured on a track by singer songwriter Henry Priestman.<br/>Founded and directed by Jonathan Chapman, the Longcroft Gospel Choir is well known in the local area, and regularly performs at parties, ceremonies, weddings and music concerts.<br/>In 2001 it was accredited with the specialist status of a Performing Arts College (re-accredited in 2006 and 2009), which brought with it the funds to increase class-room space, develop a fully working theatre in the school hall and extend links to the wider community and feeder primary schools.<br/>The site is over 50 acres and includes open spaces for sporting activities.<br/>The choir comprises students from Year 9 and above and has a large repertoire of music.<br/>People with the surname.<br/>In more recent years, Longcroft acquired funding from the East Riding of Yorkshire Council and the Football Foundation to build a new sports hall and all-weather pitch.<br/>External links.<br/>The school changed its name to Longcroft School at some time between 2009 and 2012, as it was no longer a Performing Arts College.<br/><br/>sign: Why it was used in this context is still a mystery.<br/>The evolution of the symbol as used today is not recorded.<br/>The Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola disapproves of this usage.<br/>Currently, the word arroba means both the at-symbol and a unit of weight.<br/>Commonly, people will call the symbol [\u00e6t] (as in English), particularly when giving their email addresses.<br/>This naming is because the at sign was used to represent this measure.<br/>Note that the Croatian words for monkey, majmun, opica, jopec, \u0161imija are not used to denote the symbol, except seldom the latter words regionally.<br/>In mathematics, the sign of a number tells whether it is positive or negative.<br/>Also, the sign of a permutation tells whether it is the product of an even or odd number of transpositions.<br/>Naming the symbol after animals is also common.<br/><br/>amtrack: all cities listed are terminals for some

be powered by horses, cables, gravity, pneumatics and gas turbines.<br/>Comparison of the transport mode by distance travelled.<br/>Components of a mode of transport.<br/>a wheeled passenger vehicle that carries its own motor.<br/>While all modes of transport are used for cargo transport, there is high differentiation between the nature of the cargo transport, in which mode is chosen.<br/>The most common road vehicle in the developed world is the automobile, a wheeled passenger vehicle that carries its own motor.<br/>Each mode of transport has a fundamentally different technological solution, and some require a separate environment.<br/>For liquids/gases, any chemically stable liquid or gas can be sent through a pipeline.<br/>But the infrastructure and operation of transport have a great impact on the land, and transport is the largest drainer of energy, making transport sustainability a major issue.<br/>even the air can be entered with human-powered aircraft.<br/><br/>red train: The Red Arrow is the most popular train in Russia.<br/>In 1962, the deep red colour of the train was adopted.<br/>As of June 2010 the subway train has been repaired and relaunched.<br/>In honour of the 75th anniversary of the train, a special subway train called Red Arrow - 75 Years was launched in 2006 on the Moscow Metro.<br/>As the demand for sleeper train increased even more, a private sleeper train, called Megapolis, was introduced by the Tverskoy Express company, leaving Moscow or St Petersburg after the Red Arrow and Express.<br/>To enhance capacity, a second sleeper train was introduced in 1978, called the Red Arrow 2.<br/>However in practice the main train started and terminated at Swansea with only a through portion working west of there to Carmarthen.<br/>As newly designed cars were introduced by Russian Railways in 2007, the Red Arrow 2 was renamed Express.<br/>In designing the interior of the compartment cars, mainly wood is used.<br/>On 29 March 2010 the subway train was bombed in the terrorist attack at Lubyanka station.<br/><br/>the model: The interactions between all the particles described by the Standard Model are summarized by the diagrams

speed will depend on how many blocks are open in front of it.<br/>Some rapid transport trains have extra features such as wall sockets and internet connectivity.<br/>Current official transit maps of the New York City Subway are based on a 1979 design by Michael Hertz Associates.<br/>Based on the line number, for example Sinyongsan station, coded as station 429.<br/>for example, they show the interchange stations where passengers can transfer between lines.<br/>Advocates of this system note that it is much quieter than conventional steel-wheeled trains, and allows for greater inclines given the increased traction of the rubber tires.<br/>For instance, in 2010, one R142A train set on the 6 route was wrapped with a Target advertisement.<br/>Continuously welded rail, which is also being installed, reduces the noise being made by the wheels of trains.<br/><br/>commuter train: Alternative names are \"local train\" or \"stopping train\".<br/>However, few people sit in the middle

instead.<br/>Paper made from wood pulp is not necessarily less durable than a rag paper.<br/>Mechanical pulps have rather short fibres, thus producing weak paper.<br/>Book publishers tend to use acid-free paper, made from fully bleached chemical pulps for hardback and trade paperback books.<br/>Paper made from chemical pulps are also known as wood-free papers (not to be confused with tree-free paper).<br/>Most recycled paper contains a proportion of virgin fibre for the sake of quality.<br/>Printing paper is generally between 60 g and 120 g.<br/>Chemical pulping processes are not

fats.<br/>Chinese pastry is made from rice, or different types of flour, with fruit, sweet bean paste or sesame-based fillings.<br/>These pastries are very delicate and flaky.<br/>Many pastries are prepared using shortening, a fat food product that is solid at room temperature, the composition of which lends to creating crumbly, shortcrust-style pastries and pastry crusts.<br/>The classical period of ancient Greece and Rome had pastries made with almonds, flour, honey and seeds.<br/>Some dishes, such as pies, are made of a pastry casing that covers or completely contains a filling of various sweet or savory ingredients.<br/>Roman cuisine used flour, oil and water to make pastries that were used to cover meats and fowls during baking in order to keep in the juices, but the pastry was not meant to be eaten.<br/>This is a list of pastries, which are small buns made using a stiff dough enriched with fat.<br/>Puff pastry is made using a laminated dough consisting of flour, butter,

as self-controlled heating elements in, for example, the rear-window defrost circuits of automobiles.<br/>It is constructed of two or more alternating layers of ceramic and a metal layer acting as the electrodes.<br/>Early ceramics were porous, absorbing water easily.<br/>These ceramics are used in non-ferrous molten metal handling, weld pins, and the chemical industry.<br/>Advanced ceramics are also used in the medicine, electrical, electronics industries, and body armor.<br/><br/>dough: Some flatbreads, such as naan, use leavening agents.<br/>Pancakes, waffles, some kinds of bar cookies such as brownies, and many cakes and quick breads (including muffins and the like) are often made with a semi-liquid batter of flour and liquid that is poured into the final shape, rather than a solid dough.<br/>Crackers are also made from dough, and some (such as saltine crackers) are leavened.<br/>Dough is typically made by mixing flour with a small amount of water and/or other liquid, and sometimes includes yeast or other leavening agents as well as other ingredients such as various fats or flavorings.<br/>Flatbreads such as pita, lafa, lavash, matzah or matzo, naan, roti, sangak, tortilla, and yufka are eaten around the world and are also made from dough.<br/>Leavened or fermented doughs (generally made from grain cereals or legumes that are ground to produce flour, mixed with water and yeast) are used all over the world to make various breads.<br/>In countries in the Sahel region of Africa, dough balls called aiysh or biya are made from sorghum or millet, and are ground and boiled.<br/>Pasta and noodles are generally based on unleavened doughs that are worked until they are dry and smooth, and then shaped into their final form.<br/>Pasta is typically made from a dry dough that is kneaded and shaped, either through extrusion, rolling out in a pasta machine, or stretched or shaped by hand (as for gnocchi or dumplings).<br/>Many cultures have dishes that are prepared by deep frying dough in many various forms.<br/><br/>brown donut,doughnut: These pastries are not sweet and are often served with congee, a traditional rice porridge or soy milk.<br/>Local varieties of doughnuts sold by peddlers and street vendors throughout the Philippines are usually made of plain well-kneaded dough, deep-fried in refined coconut oil and sprinkled with refined (not powdered or confectioner's) sugar.<br/>They are made of a special type of bread filled with \"goiabada\" (guava jelly) or milk cream, and covered by white sugar.<br/>A few sweet, doughnut-style pastries are regional in nature.<br/>The vada is made from dal, lentil or potato flours rather than wheat flour.<br/>The preparation is almost exactly the same as doughnuts, though there are variants made from glutinous rice flour.<br/>In India, an old-fashioned sweet called gulgula is made of sweetened, deep-fried flour balls.<br/>Pampushky are made of yeast dough containing wheat, rye or buckwheat flour.<br/>Sweet pastries similar to old-fashioned doughnuts called badushahi and jalebi are also popular.<br/>It is made with rice flour, duck eggs, and sugar that is molded into rope-like strands and then fried in a loose spiral.<br/><br/>bread: sweet or savoury bread puddings are made with bread and various liquids.<br/>Many breads are leavened by yeast.<br/>Many breads are made from a \"straight dough\", which means that all of the ingredients are combined in one step, and the dough is baked after the rising time.<br/>Sourdough breads are made with a sourdough starter.<br/>Most bread eaten in the West is leavened.<br/>Bread is usually made from a wheat-flour dough that is cultured with yeast, allowed to rise, and finally baked in an oven.<br/>Most artisan bread formulas contain anywhere from 60 to 75% water.<br/>Common table breads made from these doughs result in a finely textured, light bread.<br/>others are made from a \"pre-ferment\" in which the leavening agent is combined with some of the flour and water a day or so ahead of baking and allowed to ferment overnight.<br/>Rye bread contains phenolic acids and ferulic acid dehydrodimers.<br/><br/>donuts: These
