English.<br/>The shoes themselves are made of flexible compounds, typically featuring a sole made of dense rubber.<br/>Sneakers (also called trainers, athletic shoes, tennis shoes, gym shoes, kicks,

wear.<br/>An example of this is the spiked shoe developed for track running.<br/>The term 'athletic shoes' is typically used for shoes utilized for jogging or road running and indoor sports such as basketball, but tends to exclude shoes for sports played on grass such as association football and rugby football, which are generally known in North America as \"cleats\" and in British English as \"boots\" or \"studs\".<br/><br/><strong>white shoe</strong><strong>: </strong>The phrase \"white shoe\" has a distinctly different meaning and history in Australia.<br/>it is also sometimes used in a derogatory manner to denote stodginess, elitism, or a lack of diversity.<br/>The following US firms are often referred to as being white-shoe firms:.<br/>A similar term in Australia, \"white shoe brigade\", has been used in the past to describe a group of Queensland property developers who backed, and benefitted from, former Queensland State Premier Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen.<br/>The phrase derives from \"white bucks\", laced suede or buckskin shoes with a red sole, long popular among the student body of Ivy League colleges.<br/>\" In the 21st century, the term is sometimes used in a

magic circle.<br/>The term typically, though not always, refers to financial, law, and management consulting firms, traditionally those based in the Northeastern United States, including New York City and Boston.<br/>The term is a contemptuous allusion to the lower social class antecedents of such men, revealed by their gaudy and tasteless choice of clothing, which included brightly coloured or

requires transfer tables.<br/>The Lamella system (also known as the Von Roll system) was developed by the Von Roll company after the rolled steel rails used in the Strub system became unavailable.<br/>It uses a ladder rack, formed of steel plates or channels connected by round or square rods at regular intervals.<br/>The Abt system is cheaper to build than the Riggenbach because it requires a lower weight of rack over a given length.<br/>The Strub rack system was invented by Emil Strub in 1896.<br/>The Fell mountain railway system, developed in the 1860s, is not strictly speaking a rack railway, since there are no cogs with teeth.<br/>The Riggenbach system is similar in design to the Marsh system.<br/>The Lamella rack can be used by locomotives designed for use on the Riggenbach or the Strub systems, so long as the safety-jaws that were a feature of the original Strub system are not used.<br/>The Morgan rack was good for grades of up to 16 percent.<br/>The Abt

can dress appropriately and can even layer their clothing should they need to go outside or should their heating fail.<br/>Minnesota experienced a rare May snowstorm as a result of this cold wave.<br/>Globally, more people die during hot weather than cold weather.<br/>Some places like Germany, France, Italy, Romania and Spain had record cold temperatures well below 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F).<br/>Fires become even more of a hazard during extreme cold.<br/>Some may even choose to migrate to places of milder climates, at least during the winter.<br/>Both cold waves and heat waves cause deaths, though different groups of people may be susceptible to different weather events.<br/>A cold wave can cause death and injury to livestock and wildlife.<br/>Extreme winter cold often causes poorly insulated water pipelines and mains to freeze.<br/>In some places, such as Siberia, extreme cold requires that fuel-powered machinery to be used even part-time must be run

speed and scale of textile production has been altered almost beyond recognition by industrialization and the introduction of modern manufacturing techniques.<br/>Cotton, flax, jute, hemp, modal and even banana and bamboo fibre are all used in clothing.<br/>Due to the often highly technical and legal requirements of these products, these textiles are typically tested in order to ensure they meet stringent performance requirements.<br/>Polyester fibre is used in all types of clothing, either alone or blended with fibres such as cotton.<br/>Straw and bamboo are both used to make hats.<br/>Different types of rayon can imitate the feel and texture of silk, cotton, wool, or linen.<br/><br/><strong>sport</strong><strong>: </strong>Sport betting is in some cases severely regulated, and in some cases is central to the sport.<br/>These trends are seen by many as contrary to the fundamental ethos of sport being carried on for its own sake and for the enjoyment of its participants.<br/>Germany used the Olympics to give off a peaceful image while secretly preparing for war.<br/>Other organisations, such as the Council of Europe, preclude activities without a physical element from classification as sports.<br/>Some sports also use it to allow off-field decision making.<br/>Nationalism is often evident in the pursuit of sport, or in its reporting: people compete in national teams, or commentators and audiences can adopt a partisan view.<br/>The competitive nature of sport encourages some participants to attempt to enhance their performance through the use of medicines, or through other means such as increasing the volume of blood in their bodies through artificial means.<br/>Other bodies advocate widening the definition of sport to include all physical activity.<br/>The practice of athletic competitions has been criticised by some Christian thinkers as a form of idolatry, in which \"human beings extol themselves, adore themselves, sacrifice

is particularly important for children and for sports.<br/>Mercury is cold during its night because it has no atmosphere to trap in heat from the Sun.<br/>Soviet investment in the defense sector was

frostbite leads to so-called chilblains or even to the death of entire body parts.<br/><br/><strong>stay warm</strong><strong>: </strong>Heating is expensive because of the lack of insulation and the draftiness of housing.<br/>This kotatsu came about with the popular use of tatami matting in Japanese homes.<br/>A kotatsu is a relatively inexpensive way to stay warm in the winter, as the futons trap the warm air.<br/>Families may choose to concentrate their activity in this one area of the house in order to save on energy costs.<br/>Most Japanese housing is not insulated to the same degree as a Western domicile and does not have central heating, thus relying primarily on space heating.<br/>The kotatsu was designed when people most commonly wore traditional Japanese style clothes, where the heat would enter through the bottom of the robes and rise to exit around the neck, thus heating the entire body.<br/>Traditionally, children are told that they will catch a cold if they sleep under a kotatsu.<br/>Thus, the kotatsu became completely mobile with electricity and became a common feature of Japanese homes during winter.<br/>The kotatsu usually is set on a thin futon, like a

traditional and non-Western cultures, getting married is the most common and definitive distinction between boyhood and manhood.<br/>In Western culture, for example, greater masculinity usually brings greater social status.<br/>While the majority of men are heterosexual, significant minorities are homosexual or bisexual.<br/>Although in general men suffer from many of the same illnesses as women, they suffer from slightly more illnesses in comparison to women.<br/>Secondary sexual characteristics that are specific to men include:.<br/>Some men identify as mostly straight.<br/>Male sexuality and attraction vary from person to person, and a man's sexual behavior can be affected by many factors, including evolved predispostions, personality, upbringing, and culture.<br/>To what extent masculinity is biologically or socially influenced is subject to debate.<br/>Many English words such as virtue and virile (from the Indo-European root vir meaning man) reflect this.<br/>This difference in the relative amounts of these sex steroids is largely responsible for the physiological differences that distinguish men from women.<br/><br/>", "concept":

"<strong>the object</strong><strong>: </strong>Concerning the degree of object orientation, the following distinctions can be made:.<br/>Meanwhile, the same operation name among objects in an inheritance hierarchy may behave differently.<br/>This variable is late-bound.<br/>The attributes and methods of the prototype are delegated to all the objects of the equivalence class defined by this

that form messages, such as their length, code point and data values.<br/>The messages that flow between computers to request services in a client-server environment can be designed as the linearizations of objects defined by class objects known to both the client and the server.<br/><br/><strong>west</strong><strong>: </strong>In a map with north at the top, west is on the left.<br/>West is the direction opposite that of the Earth's rotation on its axis, and is therefore the general direction towards which the Sun appears to constantly progress and eventually set.<br/>To an observer on the surface of Venus, the Sun would rise in the west and set in the east although Venus's opaque clouds prevent observing the Sun from the planet's surface.<br/>According to the Bible, the Israelites crossed the Jordan River westward into the Promised Land.<br/>All demons are part of the East.<br/>This is not true on the planet Venus, which rotates in the opposite direction from the Earth (retrograde rotation).<br/>In Saberhagen's Empire of the East series, the rival powers are West and East, including both humans and supernatural beings.<br/>In Tolkien's earlier work, the north had been the direction of evil.<br/>Ancient Egyptians also believed that the Goddess Amunet was a personification of the West.<br/>The concept of the Western part of the earth has its roots in the Western Roman Empire and the Western Christianity.<br/><br/><strong>direction should the object</strong><strong>: </strong>For example, an object to the East would have an absolute bearing of 90 degrees.<br/>For example, an object relative bearing of 0 degrees would be dead ahead.<br/>an object relative bearing 180 degrees would be behind.<br/>A bearing can be taken to a fixed or moving object in order to target it with gunfire or missiles.<br/>Accordingly, the direction at A of B, expressed as a bearing, is not in general the opposite of the direction at B of A (when traveling on the great circle formed by A and B).<br/>Example: The navigator on a ship observes a lighthouse when its relative bearing is 45\u00b0 and again when it is 90\u00b0.<br/>25\u00b0 relative would be 'one point abaft the starboard beam' and an object at 213.<br/>Relative bearing refers to the angle between the craft's forward direction and the location of another object.<br/>See the end point on a map when you specify a start point, a bearing and a distance.<br/>He now knows that the distance from the ship to the lighthouse is equal to the distance travelled by the vessel between both observations.<br/><br/><strong>ceiling fan</strong><strong>: </strong>Also, if one is carrying a long and awkward object, one end may inadvertently enter the path of rotation of a ceiling fan's blades, which can cause damage to the fan.<br/>A downrod, a metal pipe used to suspend the fan from the ceiling.<br/>A mechanism for mounting the fan to the ceiling such as:.<br/>A type of mounting system where the ceiling fan hangs on a hardened metal hook, screwed into the ceiling or bolted through a steel I-beam.<br/>This action works to even out the temperature in the room, making it cooler nearer the ceiling, but warmer nearer the floor.<br/>The direction that a fan spins should change based on whether the room needs to be heated or cooled.<br/>Contrary to popular misconception, wobbling alone will not cause a ceiling fan to fall.<br/>Some fans have their control(s) mounted on the wall instead of on the fans themselves.<br/>The fan can be mounted directly on a ceiling hook, making the junction box optional.<br/>In one position, the fan is caused to rotate clockwise, in the other position the fan is caused to rotate counter-clockwise.<br/><br/><strong>overhead</strong><strong>: </strong>Normally the downward pull of the weights and the reactive upward pull of the tensioned wires lifts the pulley so its teeth are well clear of a stop on the mast.<br/>The pulley can turn freely while the weights move up or down as the wires contract or expand.<br/>With AT the continuous length of overhead line is limited due to the change in the height of the weights as the overhead line expands and contracts with temperature changes.<br/>As the pantograph moves along under the contact wire, the carbon insert on top of the pantograph becomes worn with time.<br/>It presses against the underside of the lowest overhead wire, the contact wire.<br/>This stops further rotation, limits the damage, and keeps the undamaged part of the wire intact until it can be repaired.<br/>This can result in poor electrical contact between the collector and the overhead line, resulting in electrical arcing and power surges.<br/>Problems with overhead equipment.<br/>Alternatively, section breaks can be sited at the crossing point, so that the crossing is electrically dead.<br/>To make the wire stronger, 0.<br/><br/><strong>chair</strong><strong>: </strong>Hence in some chair designs, the armrest is not continuous to the chair back, but is missing in the elbow area.<br/>otherwise the occupant is too far away from the desk or table.<br/>The back of the chair will support some of the weight of the occupant, reducing the weight on other parts of the body.<br/>Center seats where a solid material forms the chair seat.<br/>All pages with titles containing the chair.<br/>Chair glides are attached to the feet of chairs to prevent them from scratching or snagging on the floor.<br/>This anthropometric measurement is used to determine the seat depth.<br/>By matching the shape of the occupant's buttocks, weight is distributed and maximum pressure is reduced.<br/>However, the person who is first chair in the first violin section is usually referred to as the concertmaster in the US or leader in the UK.<br/>Under these higher loads, the chair may be damaged, but it must not fail catastrophically.<br/><br/><strong>south should the object</strong><strong>: </strong>Thus, the objects can be receivers of both love and hate, the affective effects of the libido and the death drive.<br/>Likewise, the infant who destroyed the bad object is not the infant who loves the good object.<br/>The introjection of the good object, first of all the mother\u2019s breast, is a precondition for normal development.<br/>In Kashmiri, the word order in embedded clauses is conditioned by the category of the subordinating conjunction, as in Example 3.<br/>Part objects are a function of splitting, which takes place in phantasy.<br/>Introjection of the good object is also used by the ego as a defense against anxiety.<br/>Internal objects are formed by the patterns in one's experience of being taken care of as a baby, which may or may not be accurate representations of the actual, external caretakers.<br/>Klein notes that in splitting the object, the ego is also split.<br/>\u201cBefore the depressive position, a good object is not in any way the same thing as a bad object.<br/>Freud originally identified people in a subject's environment with the term \"object\" to identify people as the object of drives.<br/><br/><strong>furniture</strong><strong>: </strong>Methods for determination of stability of non-domestic storage furniture (British Standard).<br/>The geometric rosette accompanies the ogive many times, having a big variety of forms.<br/>Usually, the locks and escutcheon of chests have also an ornamental scope, being finely made.<br/>Strength and stability of furniture.<br/>It is likely that the style of furniture prevalent in late antiquity persisted throughout the middle ages.<br/>This will be evident to anyone who will visit, first the Palace of Versailles, then the Grand Trianon, and afterwards the Petit Trianon.<br/>He discovered the benefits of a waterbed for recuperation.<br/>The practice of using natural objects as rudimentary pieces of furniture likely dates to the beginning of human civilisation.<br/>The English usage, referring specifically to household objects, is specific to that language.<br/>Casters which make some furniture moveable.<br/><br/><strong>carpet</strong><strong>: </strong>In fact, the circumstance in which the substance is viewed by the camera is still ambiguous.<br/>The exact nature of the substance that is deposited on Michael's carpet is never made clear.<br/>This happened when the fibres degraded over time and short strands broke away with contact or friction.<br/>Until the mid-18th century they were mostly used on walls and tables.<br/>With judicial and skilful planting of colours in the frames the number of colours could be increased to about twenty, enabling complex designs to be produced.<br/>The carpet is produced on a loom quite similar to woven fabric.<br/>There are new styles of carpet combining the two styles called cut and loop carpeting.<br/>Still, some show figures engaged either in the hunt or feasting scenes.<br/>Except in royal or ecclesiastical settings they were considered too precious to cover the floor.<br/>Historically, the term \"carpet\" was also applied to table and wall coverings, as carpets were not commonly used on the floor in European interiors until the 15th century.<br/><br/><strong>north</strong><strong>: </strong>This means some objects, such as Uranus, rotate in the retrograde direction: when seen from the IAU north, the spin is clockwise.<br/>The visible rotation of the night sky around the visible celestial pole provides a vivid metaphor of that direction corresponding to \"up\".<br/>On any rotating astronomical object, north often denotes the side appearing to rotate counter-clockwise when viewed from afar along the axis of rotation.<br/>By convention, the top side of a map is often north.<br/>Similarly, the other cardinal directions are also related to the sun's position.<br/>The area Sektion 12 on the lower \"B-stand\" grew so popular that the fans in a dialogue with the club made it bigger.<br/>east and west would not be 180 degrees apart, but instead would differ from that by up to twice the degrees of latitude of the location in question, and.<br/>Maps tend to be drawn for viewing with either true north or magnetic north at the top.<br/>occasionally with a single arrow oriented to the map's representation of magnetic north, or two arrows oriented to true and magnetic north respectively,.<br/>usually with a single arrow oriented to the map's representation of true north,.<br/><br/><strong>clockwise</strong><strong>: </strong>Then, when the Sun moves in the sky (from east to south to west), the shadow, which is cast on the sundial in the opposite direction, moves with the same sense of rotation (from west to north to east).<br/>Similarly, the flyer whorl of a spinning wheel uses a left-hand thread to keep it from loosening.<br/>This effect is caused by the plane of the dial having been rotated through the plane of the motion of the sun and thus the shadow is observed from the other side of the dial's plane and is observed as moving in the opposite direction.<br/>Curiously, unlike with games, there is usually no objection when the activity uncharacteristically begins in a counterclockwise motion.<br/>Typical nuts, screws, bolts, bottle caps, and jar lids are tightened (moved away from the observer) clockwise and loosened (moved towards the observer) counterclockwise in accordance with the right-hand rule.<br/>Two-dimensional rotation can occur in two possible directions.<br/>For bicycle pedals, the one on the left must be reverse-threaded to prevent it unscrewing during use.<br/>To apply the right-hand rule, place one's loosely clenched right hand above the object with the thumb pointing in the direction one wants the screw, nut, bolt, or cap ultimately to move, and the curl of the fingers, from the palm to the tips, will indicate in which way one needs to turn the screw, nut, bolt or cap to achieve the desired result.<br/>A turnbuckle has right-handed threads on one end and left-handed threads on the other.<br/>An alternative formulation with sin and cos swapped gives a clockwise trace from the upper-most point.<br/><br/><strong>pillow</strong><strong>: </strong>With a hemstitched or corded decoration around the inner edge of the valance.<br/>The appropriate size of a bed pillow depends on the size of the bed.<br/>However, U-shaped pillows can sometimes force the head forward, creating neck stiffness.<br/>Travel pillows provide support for the neck in a sitting position.<br/>The main distinguishing feature is whether the pillow case is plain or with a valance around the edge.<br/>Often, a zippered pillow protector is often placed around standard pillows with the case in turn covering the protector.<br/>For example, unless a person has some particular medical condition, they will likely use a handy decorative pillow for lumbar support, as needed, while seated on a sofa.<br/>essentially a bag, with a flap in the open end to tuck the pillowcase behind to keep it in.<br/>This pillows have a separate flap of fabric that is attached at the top of the pillow and folds down over the face.<br/>In earlier eras, pillows would often break, shedding feathers throughout a room.<br/><br/><strong>south</strong><strong>: </strong>This illustrates the effect the Allardyce Range has in breaking up cloud cover.<br/>A series of six passages separates

convention.<br/><br/><strong>should the object</strong><strong>: </strong>Override the Object.<br/>Equals method to ensure the object is compared using business logic.<br/>two value objects are equal when they have the same value, not necessarily being the same object.<br/>The Liskov substitution principle: \"objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.<br/>Value objects are among the building blocks of DDD.<br/>Make the class immutable by removing any property setters and only passing member values through the constructors.<br/>Value objects should be immutable: this is required for the implicit contract that two value objects created equal, should remain equal.<br/>It is also useful for value objects to be immutable, as client code cannot put the value object in an invalid state or introduce buggy behaviour after instantiation.<br/>GetHashCode method and ensure that the hash is same for the objects who have same equality.<br/>The following procedure can be carried out to add value object properties to a C# class:.<br/><br/><strong>propeller</strong><strong>: </strong>Therefore, it is necessary for the blade to be twisted so as to maintain a uniform angle of attack over the whole of the blade.<br/>Generally, the propellers on both engines of most conventional twin-engined aircraft spin clockwise (as viewed from the rear of the aircraft).<br/>Often, the bushing can be drawn into place with nothing more complex than a couple of nuts, washers and a threaded rod.<br/>The force felt by the blades acting to pull them away from the hub when turning.<br/>instead they may fit a rope cutter that fits around the prop shaft and rotates with the propeller.<br/>Also, the rubber bushing may perish over time leading to its failure under loads below its designed failure load.<br/>However, 'lift-and-drag' is only one way to express the aerodynamic force on the blades.<br/>The pressure on the upstream surface of the blade (the \"suction side\") can drop below the vapor pressure of the water, resulting in the formation of a vapor pocket.<br/>The transverse view shows the transverse projection of a blade and the developed outline of the blade.<br/>Forces acting on a propeller.<br/><br/><strong>overhead should the object</strong><strong>: </strong>Due to the mirroring of the image in the head of the overhead projector, the image on the wall is \"re-flipped\" to where it would be if one was looking at the LCD screen normally.<br/>The result is different from the result a shallow copy gives in that the objects referenced by the copy B are distinct from those referenced by A, and independent.<br/>However, because the lamp was suspended above and outside the reflector, a large amount of light was cast to the sides inside the projector body that was wasted, thus requiring a higher power lamp for sufficient screen illumination.<br/>This has the greatest effect towards the outer edges of the projected image, so that one typically sees either blue or brown fringing at the edge of the screen when the focus is towards an extreme.<br/>With a change in the projection distance, the focusing must be readjusted for a sharp image.<br/>Next, it is reflected horizontally to the screen.<br/>This, coupled with a wide angle lens and an overhead reflector, directs the light vertically upward through the stage.<br/>Second, because the type is generic, the compiler ensures that the destination object and the source object have the same type.<br/>copy performs shallow

beads of water that form and condense inside the waveguide change the characteristic impedance and frequency, degrading the signal.<br/>The differences in particle size dictate if the silica gel should be used for flash or gravity chromatography.<br/>Additionally, the gel acts as a processing aid when the cable is being constructed, keeping the fibers central whilst the tube material is extruded around it.<br/>However, material silica gel removes moisture by adsorption onto the surface of its numerous pores rather than by absorption into the bulk of the gel.<br/>Once saturated with water, the gel can be regenerated by heating it to 120 \u00b0C (250 \u00b0F) for 1\u20132 hours.<br/>It is common for a small compressed air system (similar to a small home aquarium pump) to be employed to circulate the air inside the waveguide over a jar of silica gel.<br/>Note 1: The network component of a hydrogel is usually a polymer network.<br/>Because of the inherent cross-links, the structural integrity of the hydrogel network does not dissolve from the high concentration of water.<br/>Open network formed by the removal of all swelling agents from a

their wages.<br/>The term casting couch originally referred to physical couches in the casting office, but is now a metonym for the phenomenon as a whole.<br/>Although a couch is used primarily for seating, it may be used for sleeping.<br/>Sectional sofas are used to wrap around walls or other furniture.<br/>It is commonly found in the form of a bench, with upholstered armrests, and often fitted with springs and tailored cushions.<br/>The loveseat is designed for seating two people, while the sofa has more than two cushion seats.<br/>Couch is predominantly used in North America, South Africa, Australia and Ireland, whereas the terms sofa and settee (U and non-U) are most commonly used in the United Kingdom and India.<br/>An actor's decision of whether to provide sex is comparable to the prisoner's dilemma, and results in a tragedy of the commons in which sex is needed to obtain film roles from producers who demand it, but fails to provide an advantage relative to other actors who

ceiling fan's blades, which can cause damage to the fan.<br/>A downrod, a metal pipe used to suspend the fan from the ceiling.<br/>A mechanism for mounting the fan to the ceiling such as:.<br/>A type of mounting system where the ceiling fan hangs on a hardened metal hook, screwed into the ceiling or bolted through a steel I-beam.<br/>This action works to even out the temperature in the room, making it cooler nearer the ceiling, but warmer nearer the floor.<br/>The direction that a fan spins should change based on whether the room needs to be heated or cooled.<br/>Contrary to popular misconception, wobbling alone will not cause a ceiling fan to fall.<br/>Some fans have their control(s) mounted on the wall instead of on the fans themselves.<br/>The fan can be mounted directly on a ceiling hook, making the junction box optional.<br/>In one position, the fan is caused to rotate clockwise, in the other position the fan is caused to rotate counter-clockwise.<br/><br/>", "concept":

animals, such as horses (domesticated in the 4th or the 3rd millennium BCE), oxen (from about 8000 BCE).<br/>Another style of unit train is a local trash train, D765, that runs between the Maryland towns of Derwood and Dickerson.<br/>The Industrial Revolution in the 19th century saw a number of inventions fundamentally change transport.<br/>Early water transport was accomplished with ships that were either rowed or used the wind for propulsion, or a combination of the two.<br/>In the 1950s the introduction of containerization gave massive efficiency gains in freight transport, fostering globalization.<br/>Most such transport infrastructure came under government control in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, culminating in the nationalization of inter-city passenger rail-service with the establishment of Amtrak.<br/>While all modes of transport are used for cargo transport, there is high differentiation between the nature of the cargo transport, in which mode is chosen.<br/>Another group of projects are the \"heavy\" units.<br/>The 19th century also saw the development of the steam ship, which sped up global transport.<br/><br/><strong>1800's</strong><strong>: </strong>The man behind the project was an engineering consultant to Volvo, Helmer Petterson, who in the 1940s was responsible for the Volvo

take off with only 68 cars sold.<br/>From 1963 to 1972 the M41 gearbox with electrically actuated Laycock de Normanville overdrive was a popular option.<br/>This setback almost caused the project to

\"railways\" are monorails, high-speed railways, maglev, atmospheric railways, rubber-tired underground, funicular and cog railways.<br/>An alternative type of \"intermodal\" vehicle, known as a roadrailer, is designed to be physically attached to the train.<br/>One notable and growing long-distance train category is high-speed rail, which generally runs at speeds above 200 km/h (120 mph) and often operates on dedicated track that is surveyed and prepared to accommodate high speeds.<br/>Trains are a very efficient mode of transport to cope with large traffic demand in a metropolis.<br/>There are various types of trains that are designed for particular purposes.<br/>There are simple types of open-topped wagons for transporting minerals and bulk material such as coal, and tankers for transporting liquids and gases.<br/>A developing technology is fuel cells, which combine the advantage of not needing an electrical system in place, with the advantage of emissionless operation.<br/>The first successful example of a high-speed passenger rail system was Japan's Shinkansen, colloquially known as the \"bullet train\", which commenced operation in October 1964.<br/>One of the most common types on modern railways are intermodal (container) trains, where the containers can be lifted on and off the train by cranes and loaded off or onto trucks or ships.<br/>An early

issue.<br/><br/><strong>diesel source</strong><strong>: </strong>diesel engines are simply compression-ignition engines, and can operate on a variety of different fuels, depending on configuration and location.<br/>A diesel compression-ignition engine is usually designed to run on diesel fuel, but some types are adapted for other liquid fuels or natural gas.<br/>Diesel engines can work with the full spectrum of crude oil distillates, from natural gas, alcohols, gasoline, wood gas to the fuel oils from diesel oil to cheaper residual fuels that are like lard at room temperature, and must be heated to enable them to flow down a fuel line.<br/>The total capacity of reliably operable standby generation in Britain is estimated to be around 20 GW, nearly all of which is driven by diesel engines.<br/>Larger engines (from about 3 MWe to 30 MWe) sometimes use heavy oils, essentially tars, derived from the end of the refining process.<br/>This is implemented by introducing gas with the intake air and using a small amount of diesel fuel for ignition.<br/>In more rural situations, or for low load factor plant, diesel fuel derived from crude oil is a common fuel.<br/>Such a diesel-electric arrangement is also used in some very large land vehicles such as railroad locomotives.<br/>A diesel generator will take more load when the fuel supply to its combustion system is increased, while load is released if fuel supply is decreased.<br/>An islanded power plant intended for primary power source of an isolated community will often have at least three diesel generators, any two of which are rated to carry the required load.<br/><br/><strong>bus source</strong><strong>: </strong>Early buses, known as trolleybuses, were powered by electricity supplied from overhead

United States military uses JP-8 as a \"universal fuel\" in both turbine-powered aircraft and diesel-powered ground vehicles.<br/>Most jet fuels in use since the end of World War II are kerosene-based.<br/>Deriving \"drop-in\" jet fuel from bio-based sources is ASTM approved via two routes.<br/><br/><strong>land vehicle</strong><strong>: </strong>Most land vehicles rely on friction for accelerating, decelerating and changing direction.<br/>Most vehicles, with the notable exception of railed vehicles, have at least one steering mechanism.<br/>Ion thrusters run primarily off electricity, but they also need a propellant such as caesium, or more recently xenon.<br/>Many pedalo boats also use paddle wheels for propulsion.<br/>Most motor vehicles have internal combustion engines.<br/>It is essential that a vehicle have a source of energy to drive it.<br/>Compressed gas motors have been used on some vehicles experimentally.<br/>Similarly to propeller vehicles, some vehicles use wings for propulsion.<br/>The largest vehicle in the world, the Bagger 288, is propelled by continuous tracks.<br/>Screw-propelled vehicles are propelled by auger-like cylinders fitted with helical flanges.<br/><br/><strong>fuel source</strong><strong>: </strong>These engines require clean-burning fuels.<br/>Most transportation fuels are liquids, because vehicles usually require high energy density.<br/>Other forms of transportation, railways and aircraft, also require fossil fuels.<br/>The streets of Baghdad were paved with tar, derived from petroleum that became accessible from natural fields in the region.<br/>Biofuel can be produced from any carbon source that can be replenished rapidly e.<br/>Most liquid fuels in widespread use are derived from the fossilized remains of dead plants and animals by exposure to heat and pressure inside the Earth's crust.<br/>Nuclear fuel has the highest energy density of all practical fuel sources.<br/>The most important primary energy sources are carbon-based fossil energy sources.<br/>Some fuels like natural gas, for instance, contain only very low boiling, gaseous components.<br/>Natural gas deposits are also the main source of helium.<br/><br/><strong>gasoline source</strong><strong>: </strong>At this stage, a large percentage of cars from the 1980s and early 1990s which ran on leaded gasoline were still in use,

</strong>The torches are connected with cables to the power supply and with hoses to the shielding gas source and where used, the water supply.<br/>Early shale gas wells depended on natural fractures through which gas flowed.<br/>Most grid peaking power plants and some off-grid engine-generators use natural gas.<br/>Gasoline/petrol vehicles converted to run on natural gas suffer because of the low compression ratio of their engines, resulting in a cropping of delivered power while running on natural gas (10\u201315%).<br/>Another 22 deaths were attributed to appliances running on liquified petroleum gas, and 17 deaths on gas of unspecified type.<br/>Gas tungsten arc welding uses a constant current power source, meaning that the current (and thus the heat flux) remains relatively constant, even if the arc distance and voltage change.<br/>Domestic appliances, furnaces, and boilers use low pressure, usually 6 to 7 inches of water (6\" to 7\" WC), which is about 0.<br/>Particularly high efficiencies can be achieved through combining gas turbines with a steam turbine in combined cycle mode.<br/>Typically, natural gas powered engines require 950\u20131,050 BTU/cu ft (35\u201339 MJ/m3) natural gas to operate at the rotational name plate specifications.<br/>Some jurisdictions, such as Saskatchewan, sell gas by volume only.<br/><br/><strong>jet fuel</strong><strong>: </strong>Commonly aircraft are propelled by airbreathing jet engines.<br/>The engine needs compressed air for itself just to run successfully.<br/>Jet fuel is often used in diesel-powered ground-support vehicles at airports.<br/>Industrial gas turbines can create up to 50,000 shaft horsepower.<br/>The compressor is powered by the turbine, which extracts energy from the expanding gas passing through it.<br/>A few air-breathing engines made for high speed applications (ramjets and scramjets) use the ram effect of the vehicle's speed instead of a mechanical compressor.<br/>Most modern subsonic jet aircraft use more complex high-bypass turbofan engines.<br/>Jet aircraft use such engines for long-distance travel.<br/>There are many different variations of gas turbines, but they all use a gas generator system of some type.<br/>As a result, a few aircraft engine manufacturers, most notably Thielert and Austro Engine, have begun offering aircraft diesel engines which run on jet fuel which may simplify airport logistics by reducing the number of fuel types required.<br/><br/><strong>mustafa hassan</strong><strong>: </strong>He obtained a Danish

vehicles</strong><strong>: </strong>Most large electric transport systems are powered by stationary sources of electricity that are directly connected to the vehicles through wires.<br/>Most land vehicles rely on friction for accelerating, decelerating and changing direction.<br/>Most electric vehicles use lithium-ion batteries (Li-Ions or LIBs).<br/>Most vehicles, with the notable exception of railed vehicles, have at least one steering mechanism.<br/>These systems are powered from an external generator plant (nearly always when stationary), and then disconnected before motion occurs,

original round musket ball was smaller than the bore of the barrel.<br/>This use of the term bullet when intending to describe a cartridge often leads to confusion when the components of a cartridge are specifically referred to.<br/>Behind the scenes, the four founding members of Bullet Club were best friends and travel partners.<br/>Lead: Simple cast, extruded, swaged, or otherwise fabricated lead slugs are the simplest form of bullets.<br/>Any asymmetry in the bullet is largely canceled as it spins.<br/>Exploding: Similar to the incendiary bullet, this type of projectile is designed to explode upon hitting a hard surface, preferably the bone of the intended target.<br/>The early use of these in the black-powder era was soon discontinued due to irregular and unpredictable flight patterns.<br/><br/><strong>bullet train</strong><strong>: </strong>Despite this, the government gives the order to stop the train.<br/>National Railway officials are in further disdain when they

but are built on the same platforms as a typical diesel, CNG, or hybrid bus.<br/>Some historical forms of public transport include the stagecoach, traveling a fixed route between coaching inns, and the horse-drawn boat carrying paying passengers, which was a feature of European canals from their 17th-century origins.<br/>Once built, the infrastructure will require operating and maintenance costs, adding to the total cost of public transport.<br/>Trackless train.<br/>High-speed rail networks are being developed in many parts of the world.<br/>Many, if not all, of these systems are

English, a hostler moves engines around train yards, but does not take them out on the normal tracks.<br/>The driver is in charge of, and responsible for operating the engine, as well as the mechanical operation of the train, train speed, and all train handling.<br/>How to become a train driver guide.<br/>The Center Of A Future Train Conductor.<br/>The United Kingdom based transport historian Christian Wolmar stated in October 2013 that train operators employed by the Rio Tinto Group to transport iron ore across the Australian outback were likely to be the highest-paid members of the occupation in the world at that time.<br/>In India, a driver starts as a diesel assistant (or electrical assistant for electric locomotives).<br/>A train driver, engine driver or locomotive driver, commonly known as an engineer in the United States and Canada, and also as a locomotive handler, locomotive operator, train operator, or motorman, is a person who drives a train.<br/>For many American railroads, the following career progression is typical: assistant conductor (brakeman), train conductor and finally the engineer.<br/><br/><strong>name</strong><strong>: </strong>Today, this style of name is still used in Jewish religious rites.<br/>The name Mohammed and Ahmed are same, for example Suhel Ahmad or Mohammad Suhel are same.<br/>Sometimes there is a name for the car's \"decoration level\" or \"trim line\" as well: e.<br/>Kate Monk's Onomastikon Names over the world throughout the history.<br/>In the Old Testament, the names of individuals are meaningful, and a change of name indicates a change of status.<br/>We can see many Arabic names in the Quran and in Muslim people.<br/>The Name Tradition In The Christian Culture.<br/>In certain African cultures, such as in Cameroon, the eldest son gets the family name for his given name.<br/>For some Indians, their birth name is different from their official name.<br/>They can identify a class or category of things, or a single thing, either uniquely, or within a given context.<br/><br/><strong>train</strong><strong>: </strong>The railway terminology that is used to describe a train varies between countries.<br/>Almost all monorail trains use linear induction motors.<br/>\"Piggy-back\" trains are the fastest growing type of freight train in the US, where they are also known as \"trailer on flatcar\" or TOFC trains.<br/>Double deck high speed and sleeper trains are becoming more common in mainland Europe.<br/>Special kinds of train running on corresponding purpose-built \"railways\" are monorails, high-speed railways, maglev, atmospheric railways, rubber-tired underground, funicular and cog railways.<br/>Sometimes extreme congestion of commuter trains can become a problem.<br/>There are various types of trains that are designed for particular purposes.<br/>While when referring to a train made up of a variety of vehicles, or of several sets/units, the term formation is used.<br/>Many prestigious passenger train services have been bestowed a special name, some of which have become famous in literature and fiction.<br/>A less common practice is the naming of freight trains, for the same commercial reasons.<br/><br/><strong>transport</strong><strong>: </strong>Also, a train can be powered by horses, cables, gravity, pneumatics and gas turbines.<br/>Some long-haul trains have been given a specific name.<br/>A multiple unit has powered wheels throughout the whole train.<br/>The inspection of railway equipment is essential for the safe movement of trains.<br/>Following his patent, Watt's employee William Murdoch produced a working model of a self-propelled steam carriage in that year.<br/>Many types of defect detectors are in use on the world's railroads.<br/>Most forms of train control involve movement authority being passed from those responsible for each section of a rail network to the train crew.<br/>Thus the railway system in Great Britain is the oldest in the world.<br/>Freight trains are very efficient, with economy of scale and high energy efficiency.<br/>Passenger trains.<br/><br/><strong>atl\u00e9tico nacional</strong><strong>: </strong>The colors of the team are derived from the flags of the Antioquia Department and the city of Medell\u00edn.<br/>The club was created to promote sports in the city,

school</strong><strong>: </strong>The facilities available at the school are used by many community groups and organisations during evenings, at weekends and during school holidays.<br/>Over the choir's period of existence, the choir has performed at venues such as Disneyland Paris and the Apple Store on Oxford Street, London, have released two of their own albums and have featured on a track by singer songwriter Henry Priestman.<br/>Founded and directed by Jonathan Chapman, the Longcroft Gospel Choir is well known in the local area, and regularly performs at parties, ceremonies, weddings and music concerts.<br/>In 2001 it was accredited with the specialist status of a Performing Arts College (re-accredited in 2006 and 2009), which brought with it the funds to increase class-room space, develop a fully working theatre in the school hall and extend links to the wider community and feeder primary schools.<br/>The site is over 50 acres and includes open spaces for sporting activities.<br/>The choir comprises students from Year 9 and above and has a large repertoire of music.<br/>People with the surname.<br/>In more recent years, Longcroft acquired funding from the East Riding of Yorkshire Council and the Football Foundation to build a new sports hall and all-weather pitch.<br/>External links.<br/>The school changed its name to Longcroft School at some time between 2009 and 2012, as it was no longer a Performing Arts College.<br/><br/><strong>sign</strong><strong>: </strong>Why it was used in this context is still a mystery.<br/>The evolution of the symbol as used today is not recorded.<br/>The Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola disapproves of this usage.<br/>Currently, the word arroba means both the at-symbol and a unit of weight.<br/>Commonly, people will call the symbol [\u00e6t] (as in English), particularly when giving their email addresses.<br/>This naming is because the at sign was used to represent this measure.<br/>Note that the Croatian words for monkey, majmun, opica, jopec, \u0161imija are not used to denote the symbol, except seldom the latter words regionally.<br/>In mathematics, the sign of a number tells whether it is positive or negative.<br/>Also, the sign of a permutation tells whether it is the product of an even or odd number of transpositions.<br/>Naming the symbol after animals is also

train</strong><strong>: </strong>The Red Arrow is the most popular train in Russia.<br/>In 1962, the deep red colour of the train was adopted.<br/>As of June 2010 the subway train has been repaired and relaunched.<br/>In honour of the 75th anniversary of the train, a special subway train called Red Arrow - 75 Years was launched in 2006 on the Moscow Metro.<br/>As the demand for sleeper train increased even more, a private sleeper train, called Megapolis, was introduced by the Tverskoy Express company, leaving Moscow or St Petersburg after the Red Arrow and Express.<br/>To enhance capacity, a second sleeper train was introduced in 1978, called the Red Arrow 2.<br/>However in practice the main train started and terminated at Swansea with only a through portion working west of there to Carmarthen.<br/>As newly designed cars were introduced by Russian Railways in 2007, the Red Arrow 2 was renamed Express.<br/>In designing the interior of the compartment cars, mainly wood is used.<br/>On 29 March 2010 the subway train was bombed in the terrorist attack at Lubyanka station.<br/><br/><strong>the model</strong><strong>: </strong>The interactions between all the particles

route.<br/>In 2011, the train operated on Saturdays instead of Sundays.<br/>The train's maximum speed will depend on how many blocks are open in front of it.<br/>Some rapid transport trains have extra features such as wall sockets and internet connectivity.<br/>Current official transit maps of the New York City Subway are based on a 1979 design by Michael Hertz Associates.<br/>Based on the line number, for example Sinyongsan station, coded as station 429.<br/>for example, they show the interchange stations where passengers can transfer between lines.<br/>Advocates of this system note that it is much quieter than conventional steel-wheeled trains, and allows for greater inclines given the increased traction of the rubber tires.<br/>For instance, in 2010, one R142A train set on the 6 route was wrapped with a Target advertisement.<br/>Continuously welded rail, which is also being installed, reduces the noise being made by the wheels of trains.<br/><br/><strong>commuter

especially on the Mississippi River.<br/>Then, he  poured the first steam cylinder of the world in the iron foundry at Veckerhagen.<br/>The concept was improved by the Italian Roberto Valturio in 1463, who devised a boat with five sets, where the parallel cranks are all joined to a single power source by one connecting rod, an idea adopted by his compatriot Francesco di Giorgio.<br/>The first stern-wheeler was built by Mr.<br/>This made him the first to construct a steam-powered boat (or vehicle of any kind).<br/>This was the first powered crossing of the Atlantic, although Savannah was

convinced Disney to drop the idea.<br/>It's the first comic I've ever loved.<br/>Burton directed his first music video, \"Bones\", in 2006.<br/>Burton was originally supposed to direct the film after

with the invention of the Snurfer, later credited as the first snowboard.<br/>The American surfer Tom Blake was the first to experiment with adding a fin to a surfboard, fastening the keel from an old speedboat to a surfboard in 1935.<br/>Jim Richardson, 25-year veteran shaper on the North Shore of Oahu, first pioneered this technology in the mid 1990s.<br/>Longboards are more suitable for beginners because of the board's size and ease of catching waves.<br/>He created a prototype and 30 years later his \"thruster\" design is still the most popular fin design for surfboards.<br/>It was in Hawaii that the art of standing and surfing upright on boards was invented.<br/>The first stand up surfboard ridden in Australia by Duke Kahanamoku and Isabel Letham is an oversized longboard with

Hamilton, Darrick Doerner, and Buzzy Kerbox.<br/>An early attempt at media recognition was his quest to be the first surfer to complete a 360 degree loop while strapped to his board.<br/>Kalama and Hamilton are also credited with the co-development of \"foil surfing\" (hydrofoil surfing).<br/>This innovation is chronicled in the documentary film, Riding Giants.<br/>Laird Hamilton, along with Paul Hodge and Gabrielle Reece co founded Laird Superfood in 2015.<br/>A still photograph of him riding the wave made the cover of Surfer magazine, with the caption: \"oh my god.<br/>In 1996 Hamilton

upright on boards was invented.<br/>George Freeth decided to revive the art of surfing, but had little success with the huge 500 cm (16 ft) hardwood boards that were popular at that time.<br/>When he cut them in half to make them more manageable, he created the original \"Long board\", which made him the talk of the islands.<br/>The board is nearly indestructible, but on the rare occasions it has been damaged or destroyed, the Surfer can repair or recreate it with little effort.<br/>Longer boards are good for beginners who need help balancing.<br/>Surfboards were originally made of solid wood and were large and heavy (often up to 370 cm (12 ft) long and having a mass of 70 kg (150 lb)).<br/>Modern longboards, generally 270 to 300 cm (9 to 10 ft) in length, are reminiscent of the earliest

first aluminum \u201ctorpedo\u201d rescue buoy, basing it on the steel buoy created by California lifeguard Harry Walters in  1919.<br/>Then after three years of experimenting, in 1929, Blake constructed a hollow board with transverse bracing.<br/>he was the first to build a waterproof camera housing and inaugurated the tradition of surfers documenting themselves and their friends.<br/>He personally innovated most of what's associated with surfers to this day: he was the first to experiment with making better surfboards, revolutionizing board design in the process with lightweight materials and the fin.<br/>He then began his own experiments in improving surfboard design.<br/>Blake\u2019s inventions and innovations were not limited to surfboards.<br/>Blake first attempted to ride a wave in 1921 on an old board he found while working at the Santa Monica Swim Club.<br/>Ladder Company produced them for sale.<br/>\"In the early 1930s, Blake experimented with the idea of

are more likely to be harsh and bitter.<br/>A sizable amount of research has gone into studying methods to determine the presence of flavor precursors and glycosides in the ripening grapes.<br/>With their high acidity and low sugar levels, these grapes would be under ripe and would produce table wines that many wine drinkers would consider unpalatable yet the balance of sugars and acids is well suited for sparkling wine production.<br/>The mineral components of potassium, calcium, magnesium and sodium increase in concentration as they are disseminated among the skin of the grapes and its fleshy pulp.<br/>The style of wine is usually dictated by the balance between sugars and acids.<br/>There are several factors that contribute to the ripeness of the grape.<br/>The decrease in free acids, as well as the buildup of potassium, triggers a rise in the pH level of the grape juice.<br/><br/><strong>banana</strong><strong>: </strong>The primary component of the aroma of fresh bananas is isoamyl acetate (also known as banana oil), which, along with several other compounds such as butyl acetate and isobutyl acetate, is a significant contributor to banana flavor.<br/>Most of these dishes use the Saba Banana or Cardaba banana cultivar.<br/>The flavor resembles that of artichoke.<br/>The Chinese name of the aromatic Go San Heong banana means 'You can smell it from the next mountain.<br/>The leaves of banana plants are composed of a \"stalk\" (petiole) and a blade (lamina).<br/>The tender core of the banana plant's trunk is also used in South Asian and Southeast Asian cuisine.<br/>Among other things, ethylene stimulates the formation of amylase, an enzyme that breaks down starch into sugar, influencing the taste of bananas.<br/>Banana chips are a snack produced from sliced dehydrated or fried banana or plantain, which have a dark brown color and an intense banana taste.<br/>The scientific names of most cultivated bananas are Musa acuminata, Musa balbisiana, and Musa \u00d7 paradisiaca for the hybrid Musa acuminata \u00d7 M.<br/>On the other hand, yellow bananas taste sweeter due to higher sugar concentrations.<br/><br/><strong>sweet</strong><strong>: </strong>Some of the amino acids are mildly sweet: alanine, glycine, and serine are the sweetest.<br/>The color of food can affect sweetness perception.<br/>Sweet tastes are generally regarded as pleasurable, except when in excess.<br/>Sweetness is a basic taste most commonly perceived when eating foods rich in sugars.<br/>A few substances alter the way sweet taste is perceived.<br/>While curculin has some innate sweet taste of its own, miraculin is by itself quite tasteless.<br/>Hen egg lysozyme, an antibiotic protein found in chicken eggs, is also sweet.<br/>The sweetness of 20% solution of glycine in water compares to a solution of 10% glucose or 5% fructose.<br/>One class of these inhibits the perception of sweet tastes, whether from sugars or from highly potent sweeteners.<br/>The most potent of these, lugduname, is about 225,000 times sweeter than sucrose.<br/><br/><strong>yellow banana</strong><strong>: </strong>The primary component of the aroma of fresh bananas is isoamyl acetate (also known as banana oil), which, along with several other compounds such as butyl acetate and isobutyl acetate, is a significant contributor to banana flavor.<br/>Most of

</strong>The taste of oranges is determined mainly by the relative ratios of sugars and acids, whereas orange aroma derives from volatile organic compounds, including alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, terpenes, and esters.<br/>the color of its juice is darker than that of the competing Hamlin.<br/>The juiciness of the orange.<br/>The fruit of the orange tree can be eaten fresh, or processed for its juice or fragrant peel.<br/>The majority of this crop is used mostly for juice extraction.<br/>When unripe, the fruit is green.<br/>The blood orange, with its distinct color and flavor, is generally considered favorably as a juice, and has found a niche as an ingredient variation in traditional Seville marmalade.<br/>Zest is popular in cooking because it contains oils and has a strong flavor similar to that of the orange pulp.<br/>The outermost layer of the rind can be thinly grated with a zester to produce orange zest.<br/>the fruit production and quality are similar to those of the Hamlin, but the juice has a deeper color.<br/><br/><strong>potassium</strong><strong>: </strong>The potassium content of most plants ranges from 0.<br/>The activity of natural potassium is 31 Bq/g.<br/>The crystal structure of potassium chloride is like that of NaCl.<br/>The solid dissolves readily in water, and its solutions have a salt-like taste.<br/>The combined bitterness and saltiness of high-potassium solutions makes high-dose potassium supplementation by liquid drinks a palatability challenge.<br/>The addition of 1 ppm of thaumatin considerably reduces this bitterness.<br/>The reaction of potassium with water can be violently exothermic, especially since the coproduced hydrogen gas can ignite.<br/>The potassium concentration in seawater is 0.<br/>Complaints of bitterness or a chemical or metallic taste are also reported with potassium chloride used in food.<br/>The LD50 of orally ingested potassium chloride is approximately 2.<br/><br/><strong>the taste</strong><strong>: </strong>The distinctive taste of chalk has been identified as the calcium component of that substance.<br/>while the actual taste of fatty acids is not pleasant.<br/>The taste thresholds of other bitter substances are rated relative to quinine, which is thus given a reference index of 1.<br/>These two substances taste bitter to some people, but are virtually tasteless to others.<br/>Fermented foods, such as wine, vinegar or yogurt, may have sour taste.<br/>The ethanol in alcoholic beverages tastes bitter, as do the additional bitter ingredients found in some alcoholic beverages including hops in beer and gentian in bitters.<br/>There are few regularly consumed foods rich in fat taste, due to the negative flavor that is evoked in large quantities.<br/>Many people consider blood to have a metallic taste.<br/>Other ions of the alkali metals group also taste salty, but the further from sodium, the less salty the sensation is.<br/>Sweet taste signals the presence of carbohydrates in solution.<br/><br/><strong>natural foods</strong><strong>: </strong>\" Natural flavorings are explicitly defined by separate laws.<br/>There are different standards for various types of food, such as dairy products.<br/>The term is variously misused on labels and in advertisements.<br/>The term is assumed to describe foods having ingredients that are intrinsic to an unprocessed food.<br/>There is no legal recourse to prevent this labeling.<br/>for the distribution of non-proprietary natural, organic and specialty products.<br/>The poultry industry has been criticized by the Center for Science in the Public Interest for labeling chicken meat \"all-natural\" after it has been injected with saline solution up to 25% of its weight.<br/>Because few regulations are governing the labeling of \"natural\" foods, manufacturers can include ingredients that may not be considered natural by some consumers.<br/>The guidance, in general, restricts the use of natural to foods that have \"ingredients produced by nature, not the work of man or interfered with by man.<br/>A specific ingredient can be called \"natural\" if it didn't go through any processing except for the listed ones.<br/><br/><strong>end</strong><strong>: </strong>the initial version of the film was Seth Rogen and Busta Rhymes were filming a music video and a film respectively, on the Sony lot, and Antmen attacked from the center of the earth.<br/>That's the screwball scenario of This Is the End.<br/>And the popularity of reality television now also feeds into that idea of whether what we're watching is actually real.<br/>An earthquake strikes and the crowd rushes outside, witnessing a sinkhole opening up in James' yard.<br/>Most of the film's cast portray fictional and exaggerated versions of themselves:.<br/>this rating shocked both Rogen and Goldberg, who expected an NC-17 rating for the film.<br/>The score by Henry Jackman, with additional material by Dominic Lewis and Matthew Margeson and conducted by Nick Glennie-Smith, was not officially released on its own, not even as bonus tracks on the CD or digital releases on RCA's album.<br/>The Blu-ray release fully contains the original short the film was based on, Jay and Seth versus the Apocalypse, as a special feature.<br/>The film unfolds as a profanely funny showbiz

\"mini SUV\".<br/>The next larger size is called the \"mid-size SUV\".<br/>The first SUV-like vehicle that had commercial versions was the Chevrolet Suburban panel truck.<br/>Since the early 2010s, sales of crossover-type vehicles have been increasing in Europe.<br/>Furthermore, there are inconsistencies about whether some vehicles are considered crossovers or SUVs.<br/>Some mid-size SUVs are based on platforms shared with passenger cars and therefore, are crossovers.<br/>However, these definitions are often blurred in practice, since unibody vehicles are also often referred to as SUVs.<br/>however, broader definitions consider any vehicle with off-road design features to be an SUV.<br/>Some SUVs produced today use unibody construction.<br/>It is also suggested that the term \"SUV\" has replaced \"jeep\" as a general term for off-road vehicle.<br/><br/><strong>truck</strong><strong>: </strong>This type of cab is especially suited to the delivery conditions in Europe where many roads follow the layout of much more ancient paths and trackways which require the additional turning capability given by the short wheelbase of the cab over engine type.<br/>A further step from this is the side loading forklift that can be described as a specially fabricated vehicle with the same properties as a truck of this type, in addition to the ability to pick up its own load.<br/>This type is often made by replacing the passenger side of a cab-over truck with an extended section of the load bed.<br/>Pickup trucks, called utes in Australia and New Zealand, are common in North America and some regions of Latin America, Asia, and Africa, but not so in Europe, where this size of commercial vehicle is most often made as vans.<br/>A pickup with four rear wheels instead of two is, in North America, called a \"dually\", which is able to carry more weight over the rear axle.<br/>The most-recent pickup truck on sale in Japan is Toyota Hilux.<br/>The C license category allows driving vehicles over 3.<br/>In the United States, a commercial driver's license is required to drive any type of commercial vehicle weighing 26,001 lb (11,794 kg) or more.<br/>Small trucks use the same type of transmissions as almost all cars, having either an automatic transmission or a manual transmission with synchromesh (synchronizers).<br/>Almost all heavy truck transmissions are of the \"range and split\" (double H shift pattern) type, where range change and so\u2011called half gears or splits are air operated and always preselected before the main gear selection.<br/><br/><strong>b</strong><strong>: </strong>Instead, Fraktur is considered a class of fonts of the Latin alphabet.<br/>The blood-type B emoji (\ud83c\udd71\ufe0f) was added in Unicode 6.<br/>These fonts were designed in the early 20th century, mainly the 1930s, as grotesque versions of blackletter typefaces.<br/>Groups that use both form of traditional German script are the Amish, Old Order Mennonites, Hutterites, and traditional German-speaking Mennonites from Russia who live mostly in Latin America today.<br/>however, the predominant typeface was the Normalfraktur, which came in slight variations.<br/>The present forms of the English cursive B were developed by the 17th century.<br/>Some Fraktur typefaces also include a variant form of the letter r known as the r rotunda, and many a variety of ligatures which are left over from cursive handwriting and have rules for their use.<br/>The following set of Fraktur and bold Fraktur letters is intended for use as mathematical alphanumeric symbols:.<br/>Some books at that time used related blackletter fonts such as Schwabacher.<br/>The Greek letter was an adaptation of the Phoenician letter b\u0113t

created the first marketing partnership between insurance companies and banks.<br/><br/><strong>bus</strong><strong>: </strong>Many types of buses, such as city transit buses and inter-city coaches, charge a fare.<br/>The most common type is the single-deck rigid bus, with larger loads carried by double-decker and articulated buses, and smaller loads carried by midibuses and minibuses while coaches are used for longer-distance services.<br/>Historically, the types and features of buses have developed according to local needs.<br/>The bus types in use around the world where there was little mass production were often sourced second hand from other countries, such as the Malta bus, and buses in use in Africa.<br/>Another use is as an emergency vehicle, such as high-capacity ambulance bus or mobile command centre.<br/>Other types, such as elementary or secondary school buses or shuttle buses within a post-secondary education campus do not charge a fare.<br/>While many preserved buses are quite old or even vintage, in some cases relatively new examples of a bus type can enter restoration.<br/>A bus is a vehicle designed to carry passengers.<br/>In some countries, particularly the US and Canada, buses used to transport schoolchildren have evolved into a specific design with specified mandatory features.<br/>The first mass-produced bus model was the B-type double-decker bus, designed by Frank Searle and operated by the London General Omnibus Company \u2013 it entered service in 1910, and almost 3,000 had been built by the end of the decade.<br/><br/><strong>police</strong><strong>: </strong>The average police patrol vehicle is a specially modified, four door sedan (saloon in British English).<br/>In some cases this type of policing shares aspects with espionage.<br/>Other federal agencies have jurisdiction over a specific type of crime.<br/>These units are typically called Inspectorate-General, or in the US, \"internal affairs\".<br/>Police vehicles are used for detaining, patrolling and transporting.<br/>The English system of maintaining public order since the Norman conquest was a private system of tithings known as the mutual pledge system.<br/>Many slang terms for police officers are decades or centuries old with lost etymologies.<br/>Other common pieces of police equipment include flashlights/torches, whistles, police notebooks and \"ticket books\" or citations.<br/>Regardless of size, police forces are generally organized as a hierarchy with multiple ranks.<br/>A related development is evidence-based policing.<br/><br/><strong>jeep</strong><strong>: </strong>The Jeepney is a unique type of taxi or bus created in the Philippines.<br/>\"Specific jeep-type vehicles.<br/>A precursor of the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress was also referred to as the jeep.<br/>In 1937, tractors which were supplied by Minneapolis Moline to the US Army were called jeeps.<br/>In Iceland the word Jeppi (derived from Jeep) has been used since WWII and still used for any type of SUV.<br/>Minneapolis-Moline UTX and NTX 4x4 tractors (1940\u20131944) were called 'jeeps'.<br/>military branches, these were initially called \"jeeps\", before the quarter-ton Willys MB and Ford GPW.<br/>Escort carrier \u2013 a small, anti-submarine, escort aircraft carrier was called a \"jeep carrier\" in the U.<br/>Although the term was also military slang for vehicles that were untried or untested, this exposure caused all other jeep references to fade, leaving the 4x4 with the name.<br/>Another benefit of solid axle vehicles is they tend to be easier and cheaper to \"lift\" with aftermarket suspension systems.<br/><br/><strong>car</strong><strong>: </strong>The increase in sales of SUVs is bad for fuel economy.<br/>A variety of steam-powered road vehicles were used during the first part of the 19th century, including steam cars, steam buses, phaetons, and steam rollers.<br/>Interior lights on the ceiling of the car are usually fitted for the driver and passengers.<br/>Cars are typically fitted with multiple types of lights.<br/>Sloan who established the idea of different makes of cars produced by one company, called the General Motors Companion Make Program, so that buyers could \"move up\" as their fortunes improved.<br/>On the other hand, sports cars are most often designed with only two seats.<br/>Most cars are designed to carry multiple occupants, often with four or five seats.<br/>Some vehicles also have a trunk light and, more rarely, an engine compartment light.<br/>Most definitions of cars say that they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people rather than goods.<br/>Additional individual modes of transport, such as personal rapid transit could serve as an alternative to cars if they prove to be socially accepted.<br/><br/>", "concept": "<strong>land vehicle</strong><strong>: </strong>troop transport vehicle

'rounded' for safety.<br/>In high-quality scissors, the blades can be both extremely sharp, and tension sprung \u2013 to increase the cutting and shearing tension only at the exact point where the blades meet.<br/>it is primarily the shearing action between the two blades that cuts the material.<br/>Furthermore, with right-handed scissors held by the right hand, the shearing edge is visible, but when they are used with the left hand, the cutting edge of the scissors is behind the top blade, and one cannot see what is being cut.<br/>Some quadriplegics can use a motorized mouth-operated

yields an edge that can hold its sharpness as well as a body that is tough.<br/>The handle or back of the blade has a large area compared to the fine edge.<br/>Its blade is much thicker than a knife of comparable size.<br/>The lower illustration is a modified tanto where the end is clipped and often sharpened.<br/>The back edge of the clip may have a false edge that could be sharpened to make a second edge.<br/>If the false edge is sharpened it increases the knife's effectiveness in piercing.<br/>A stronger edge is less likely to dull from fracture or from having the edge roll out of shape.<br/><br/><strong>knife</strong><strong>: </strong>Hollow ground blades have concave, beveled edges.<br/>In this case, however, the part most affected by corrosion, the edge, is still vulnerable.<br/>High carbon stainless steel blades do not discolor or stain, and maintain a sharp edge.<br/>rather, the blade itself is the actuator.<br/>Ceramic blades are hard, brittle, and lightweight: they may maintain a sharp edge for years with no maintenance at all, but are as fragile as glass and will break if dropped on a hard surface.<br/>Plastic blades are not especially sharp and typically serrated.<br/>These edges are usually serrated and are used to further enhance function.<br/>Flat ground blades have a profile that tapers from the thick spine to the sharp edge in a

from themselves and the Germany Army to others.<br/>They can now make the peace which has to be made.<br/>Rosenberg accused German Zionists of working for a German defeat and supporting Britain and the implementation of the Balfour Declaration.<br/>We would have to be ashamed of ourselves in front of our children and grandchildren if we attacked the battle front from the rear and gave it a dagger-stab.<br/>I have asked His Excellency to now bring those circles to power which we have to thank for coming so far.<br/>The belief was that the German Army did not lose World War I on the battlefield but was instead betrayed by the civilians on the home front, especially Jews, revolutionary socialists who fomented strikes and labor unrest, and the rest of the republican politicians who overthrew the Hohenzollern monarchy in the German Revolution of 1918\u20131919.<br/>\"Yes, that's it, exactly, we were stabbed in the back\".<br/>He suggests that behind these myths was a sense of communal shame, not for causing the war, but for losing it.<br/>It was claimed that these groups had not sufficiently supported the war and had played a role in selling out Germany to its

because of demand for ivory, to be used for piano keys.<br/>The use and trade of elephant ivory have become controversial because they have contributed to seriously declining elephant populations in many countries.<br/>The Buddhist cultures of Southeast Asia, including Myanmar, Thailand, Laos and Cambodia, traditionally harvested ivory from their domesticated elephants.<br/><br/><strong>sleep</strong><strong>: </strong>Sleep is a highly conserved behavior across animal evolution.<br/>Process C counteracts the homeostatic drive for sleep during the day (in diurnal animals) and augments it at night.<br/>Many cultural stories have been told about people falling asleep for extended periods of time.<br/>\" This theory is strengthened by the fact that sleep is observed to be a necessary behavior across most of the animal kingdom, including some of the least evolved animals which have no need for other functions of sleep, such as memory consolidation or dreaming.<br/>The balance between sleeping and waking is regulated by a process called homeostasis.<br/>The human organism physically restores itself during sleep, occurring mostly during slow-wave sleep during which body temperature, heart rate, and brain oxygen consumption decrease.<br/>The use of artificial light has substantially altered humanity's sleep patterns.<br/>In many nomadic or hunter-gatherer societies, people will sleep on and off throughout the day or night depending on what is happening.<br/>Bimodal sleep in humans was more common before the industrial revolution.<br/>During Ramadan, many Muslims sleep during the day rather than at night.<br/><br/><strong>indian elephant</strong><strong>: </strong>Poaching of elephants for ivory is a serious threat in some parts of Asia.<br/>In Myanmar, demand for elephant ivory for making tourist items is higher than ever before.<br/>Foreign tourists are responsible for the massive rise in price of ivory tusks which fuels the illegal killing of elephants.<br/>Elephants are classified as megaherbivores and consume up to 150 kg (330 lb) of plant matter per day.<br/>They are generalist feeders, and both

which often results in a genetic clone of the parent.<br/>Several animals are microscopic.<br/>A wide variety of terrestrial and aquatic animals are hunted for sport.<br/>Dogs have been used in hunting, while many terrestrial and aquatic animals were hunted for sports.<br/>Marine fish of many species are caught commercially for food.<br/>Other animals may have very specific feeding behaviours, such as hawksbill sea turtles primarily eating sponges.<br/>Most animals rely on the biomass and energy produced by plants through photosynthesis.<br/>Animals have been hunted and farmed for their fur to make items such as coats and hats.<br/>Nearly all animals make use of some form of sexual reproduction.<br/>Several animal phyla lack bilateral symmetry.<br/><br/><strong>tusk</strong><strong>: </strong>Most mammals with tusks have a pair of them growing out from either side of the mouth.<br/>It has been suggested that tusk's structure has evolved to be compatible with extra-oral environments.<br/>Tusks are used by humans to produce ivory, which is used in artifacts and jewellery, and formerly in other items such as piano keys.<br/>Tusks have a variety of uses depending on the animal.<br/>The narwhal's straight single helical tusk, which grows out from the center of the mouth and is present only in the male, is an exception to the typical features of tusks described above.<br/>In most tusked species both the males and the females have tusks although the males' are larger.<br/>Consequently, many tusk-bearing species have been hunted commercially and several are endangered.<br/>Continuous growth of tusks is enabled by formative tissues in the apical openings of the roots of the teeth.<br/>Elephants use their tusks as digging and boring tools.<br/>Social displays of dominance, particularly among males, are common, as is their use in defense against attackers.<br/><br/><strong>trunk</strong><strong>: </strong>Trunking is closely related to the concept of grading.<br/>This is similar to the idea of a chain of grocery stores.<br/>This is reminiscent to the structure of a tree with one trunk and many branches.<br/>TRS's are more difficult to monitor via radio scanner than conventional systems.<br/>Trunk lines are used for connecting a private branch exchange (PBX) to a telephone service provider.<br/>The shopper generally goes to the nearest grocery store, but if there are complications or congestion, the shopper may opt to go to a neighboring store.<br/>Such high-bandwidth link groups may be used to interconnect switches or to connect high-performance servers to a network.<br/>Trunked radio systems provide greater efficiency at the cost of greater management overhead.<br/>1Q

small and aquatic.<br/>The animal's sense of smell may be four times as sensitive as that of a bloodhound.<br/>They can sometimes be known for their violent behavior.<br/>One elephant has been observed to graze by kneeling on its front legs, raising on its hind legs and taking in grass with its lips.<br/>In some countries, sport hunting of the animals is legal.<br/>A newly developed tusk has a smooth enamel cap that eventually wears off.<br/><br/><strong>hunt</strong><strong>: </strong>Many species of animals have been hunted throughout history.<br/>Some animals, such as wild rabbits or squirrels, may be utilised for fur or meat, but often no use is made of the carcass.<br/>Different breeds of dogs are used for different types of hunting.<br/>All native animals are protected by law, and can only be killed under a special permit.<br/>Hunting in Australia has evolved around the hunting and eradication of various animals considered to be pests.<br/>Typically, game animals are divided into several categories for regulatory purposes.<br/>Even figures considered divine are described to have engaged in hunting.<br/>It is argued that the animals are worth more to the community for ecotourism than hunting.<br/>All these animals have been hunted to endangerment or extinction.<br/>New Zealand has a strong hunting culture.<br/><br/>", "concept": "<strong>indian

than the warp.<br/>The weave is often hidden by napping on one or both sides.<br/>The flannel-like appearance is created by creating a nap from the weft.<br/>However, it is actually just a form of fabric and there can be flannel shirts that are not plaid.<br/>However, few of the mass-produced plaid shirts available at the time were actually made out of flannel.<br/>If the flannel is not napped, it gains its softness through the loosely spun yarn in its woven form.<br/>Flannel was originally made from carded wool or worsted yarn, but is now often made from either wool, cotton, or synthetic fiber.<br/>Brushing is a mechanical process wherein a fine metal brush rubs the fabric to raise fine fibres from the loosely spun yarns to form a nap on one or both sides.<br/>Flannel is commonly used to make tartan clothing, blankets, bed sheets, and sleepwear.<br/>Flannelette can either have long or short nap, and can be napped on one or two sides.<br/><br/><strong>stomach</strong><strong>:

stripes.<br/>In the 13th century Saint Peter was portrayed next to the wheel, as patron of the cathedral.<br/>Currently, the City of Mainz uses a double wheel connected by a silver cross.<br/>The cross was first used as a coat of arms officially around 1700.<br/>The silver cross had appeared on seals as early as the late Middle Ages, the earliest example dating from 1237.<br/>The red wheel represented the line of Bolanden, the blue represented the line of Hohenfels.<br/>A wheel is known as a device on coins of the Archdiocese of Osnabr\u00fcck and appears in seals of as early as the 13th century, although during the course of time it was altered many times, the originally red wheel having become black by 1496.<br/>Insignia dating from 1300 depict the saint with both

hook is located on the long horizontal arm to lift the load which also contains its motor.<br/>Most container cranes are of this type.<br/>The plunger would slowly be raised, drawing in water, until the downward force of the weight was sufficient to force the water below it into pipes at great pressure.<br/>The crane is mobile with four groups of wheels steerable wheels, one on each corner.<br/>A \"luffing\" jib is able to move up and down.<br/>the forward part of this cantilever or jib carries the lifting trolley, the jib is extended backwards in order to form a support for the machinery and counterbalancing weight.<br/>The engine is usually mounted in the undercarriage rather than in the upper, as with crawler crane.<br/>The fork can be raised or lowered to any of the levels of a storage rack and can be extended into the rack to store and retrieve the product.<br/>The lifting hook is operated by the crane operator using electric motors to manipulate wire rope cables through a system of sheaves.<br/>The maximum unsupported height of a tower crane is around 265 ft.<br/><br/><strong>garage</strong><strong>: </strong>Occasionally, the tempo was sped up in passages sometimes referred

springs unwind and the stored tension lifts the door by turning the shaft, thus turning the cable drums, wrapping the cables around the grooves on the cable drums.<br/>Each panel of a sectional door has its own connection to the door track.<br/>When the door is lowered, the cables unwrap from the drums and the springs are rewound to full tension.<br/>The spring reduces the effort required to open the door.<br/>The operating mechanism is spring-loaded or counterbalanced to offset the weight of the door and reduce human or motor effort required to operate the door.<br/>A typical single car garage roller door has a preloaded spring inside the rolling mechanism.<br/>The stationary cone is attached to the center bearing plate.<br/>The trolley connects to this screw.<br/>Single panel doors

current method of half-pipe cutting is by use of a Zaugg Pipe Monster.<br/>Helmets are required during competition, and there are airbags on the sides of pipes during practice runs.<br/>Some ramps are constructed by spot-welding sheet metal to the frame, resulting in a fastener-free surface.<br/>Sometimes a section of the platform is cut away to form a roll-in and a channel to allow skaters to commence a ride without dropping in and perform tricks over the gap.<br/>Since the 1980s, half-pipes contain an extended flat bottom between the quarter-pipes.<br/>The plane of the transition is oriented downhill at a slight grade to allow riders to use gravity to develop speed and facilitate drainage of melt.<br/>The Pipe Dragon was used at all major resorts across Colorado and the West Coast and led to the mainstream culture of half pipes.<br/>The Pipe Monster uses five cutting edges called haspels to cut the snow, rather than a chain this also creates an elliptical shape that is

in savannas.<br/>It is often believed that savannas feature widely spaced, scattered trees.<br/>A number of techniques have been employed to clear or kill woody plants in savannas.<br/>It has been suggested by many authors that aboriginal burning created a structurally more open savanna landscape.<br/>A number of exotic plants species have been introduced to the savannas around the world.<br/>Along the trail, visitors can observe native animals, such as Florida panthers, Eastern timber wolves, and alligators in their natural habitat.<br/>However, in many savannas, tree densities are higher and trees are more regularly spaced than in forests.<br/>The consumption of herbage by introduced grazers in savanna woodlands has led to a reduction in the amount of fuel available for burning and resulted in fewer and cooler fires.<br/>Some authors have suggested that savannas and grasslands may become even more susceptible to woody plant encroachment as a result of greenhouse induced climate change.<br/>Human induced climate change resulting from the greenhouse effect may result in an alteration of the structure and function of savannas.<br/><br/><strong>baby

overhead tactical display for combat.<br/>The training system is similar to the way the Basic Role-Playing system works.<br/>The plot is usually divided so that each game location is an opportunity to reveal a new chapter in the story.<br/>However, an isometric or aerial top-down perspective is common in party-based RPGs, in order to give the player a clear view of their entire party and their surroundings.<br/>This may sometimes be implemented as a skill tree.<br/>The game is presented in an isometric view with the player in control of Zagreus.<br/>As with the technology trees seen in strategy video games, learning a particular skill in the tree will unlock more powerful skills deeper in the tree.<br/>Success at that action depends on the character's numeric attributes.<br/>The

the prototype are delegated to all the objects of the equivalence class defined by this prototype.<br/>This variable is late-bound.<br/>Every object has one prototype link (and only one).<br/>at least one other parameter object is involved in the method choice), one speaks of multiple dispatch.<br/>Object composition is used to represent \"has-a\" relationships: every employee has an address, so every Employee object has access to a place to store an Address object (either directly embedded within itself, or at a separate location addressed via a pointer).<br/>In Java, the final keyword can be used to prevent a class from being subclassed.<br/>For example, objects of type Circle and Square are derived from a common class called Shape.<br/>Languages with abstract data type support which may be used to resemble OO programming, but without all features of object-orientation.<br/>For example, the circle-ellipse problem is difficult to handle using OOP's concept of

variable.<br/><br/><strong>scroll</strong><strong>: </strong>Typically, the scroll is consumed in the process.<br/>It is unrolled from side to side, and the text is written in lines from the top to the bottom of the page.<br/>A special Chinese form of short book, called the \"whirlwind book,\" consists of several pieces of paper bound at the top with bamboo and then rolled up.<br/>The scroll is made up of 58 sections of soft sheep leather.<br/>The scroll is usually unrolled so that one page is exposed at a time, for writing or reading, with the remaining pages rolled up to the left and right of the visible page.<br/>The ink used in writing scrolls had to adhere to a surface that was rolled and unrolled, so special inks were developed.<br/>Rolls may still be many meters or feet long, and were used in the medieval and Early Modern period in Europe and various West Asian cultures for manuscript administrative documents intended for various uses, including accounting, rent-rolls, legal agreements, and inventories.<br/>Eventually, the folds were cut into sheets, or \"leaves,\" and bound together along one edge.<br/>Parchment scrolls were used by the Israelites among others before the

tower.<br/>Battle of Little Round Top.<br/>Twilight at Little Round Top.<br/>James Barnes, to Little Round Top.<br/>Big Round Top.<br/>One of the first public uses of \"Little Round Top\" was by Edward Everett in his oration at the dedication of the Soldiers' National Cemetery on November 19, 1863.<br/>Little Round Top: A Detailed Tour Guide.<br/>Hood's division stepped off first, but instead of guiding on the road, elements began to swing directly to the east in the direction of the Round Tops.<br/>The elevation in the center of Round Top is 439 feet (134 m) above sea level.<br/><br/><strong>office</strong><strong>: </strong>The type of office layout used in Japan is called an open plan, and relies on ergonomics to help make employees as productive as possible.<br/>The role of having an open layout with island-type seating allows the office to be structured so the employees are put together as teams.<br/>As a result, in 1915, the Equitable Life Insurance Company in New York City introduced the \u201cModern Efficiency Desk\u201d with a flat top and drawers below, designed to allow managers an easy view of the workers.<br/>The type of organizational structure found within the Japanese office is known as a horizontal structure.<br/>Taylor (1856-1915) led to the \"Modern Efficiency Desk\" of 1915 with a flat top and drawers below, designed to allow managers an easy view of the workers.<br/>In order to get group members to work effectively in the open office floor plan the use of island-style desks are used.<br/>Support spaces in an office are typically used for secondary activities such as filing documents or taking a break.<br/>The Japanese open office layout allows them to use an organizational structure known as the horizontal structure.<br/>Also they are able to implement policies using the ringi-sho consensus.<br/>Work spaces in an office are typically used for conventional office activities such as reading, writing and computer work.<br/><br/><strong>books</strong><strong>: </strong>Some physical books are made with pages thick and sturdy enough to support other physical objects, like a scrapbook or photograph album.<br/>The inside back cover page, like that inside the front cover, is usually blank.<br/>Many types of book are private, often filled in by the owner, for a variety of personal records.<br/>The inside front cover page is usually left blank in both hardcover and paperback books.<br/>Hardcover books have a stiff binding.<br/>It was historically used for writing documents, notes, or the pages of a book.<br/>There are texts written in red or even gold, and different colors were used for illumination.<br/>They often feature spiral coil bindings at the edge so that pages may easily be torn out.<br/>The first books used parchment or vellum (calfskin) for the pages.<br/>Finally, the book was bound by the bookbinder.<br/><br/><strong>video game</strong><strong>: </strong>Early games used interactive electronic devices with various display formats.<br/>Some motion sensor games are based on where the controller is.<br/>Other game controllers are commonly used for specific games like racing wheels, light guns or dance pads.<br/>Video game can use several types of input devices to translate human actions to a game.<br/>Arcade games often have brightly painted logos and images relating to the theme of the game.<br/>While most arcade games are housed in a vertical cabinet, which the user typically stands in front of to play, some arcade games use a tabletop approach, in which the display screen is housed in a table-style cabinet with a see-through table top.<br/>With table-top games, the users typically sit to play.<br/>Other type of motion sensor games are webcam style where the player moves around in front of it, and the actions are repeated by a game character.<br/>There are some controllers that have presets so that the buttons are mapped a certain way to make playing certain games easier.<br/>Another example is motion sensor where a person's movement is able to be captured and put into a game.<br/><br/><strong>compute</strong><strong>: </strong>The program has an executable form that the computer can use directly to execute the instructions.<br/>Abaci, of a more modern design, are still used as calculation tools today.<br/>This allows the separation of RAM from CPU by optical interconnects.<br/>Quantum computing is often used for scientific research where a normal computer does not have nearly enough computational power to do the calculations necessary.<br/>Instructions express the computations performed by the computer.<br/>This means the qubit is not somewhere between 1 and 0, but actually the value of the qubit will change depending on when you measure it.<br/>The earliest known tool for use in computation was the abacus, and it was thought to have been invented in Babylon circa 2400 BC.<br/>In earlier times, it was used in reference to the action performed by mechanical computing machines, and before that, to human computers.<br/>Those actions produce effects according to the semantics of the instructions.<br/>This source code is written in a programming language, which is an artificial language often more restrictive or demanding than natural languages, but easily translated by the computer.<br/><br/><strong>computer</strong><strong>: </strong>Slide rules with special scales are still used for quick performance of routine calculations, such as the E6B circular slide rule used for time and distance calculations on light aircraft.<br/>The abacus was initially used for arithmetic tasks.<br/>Registers are used for the most frequently needed data items to avoid having to access main memory every time data is needed.<br/>A digital computer is capable of simulating various information processes.<br/>Sometimes programs are executed by a hybrid method of the two techniques.<br/>A 2016-era flat screen display contains its own computer circuitry.<br/>It is a hand-operated analog computer for doing multiplication and division.<br/>ROM is typically used to store the computer's initial start-up instructions.<br/>The use of counting rods is one example.<br/>The term hardware covers all of those parts of a computer that are tangible physical objects.<br/><br/><strong>stacked papers</strong><strong>: </strong>This time, the cable protocol is used to send the data to C.<br/>Instead, the layer provides the definitions that permit translation to occur between a range of services or technologies used below.<br/>Most animal caches are of food.<br/>Thus, in somewhat abstract terms, at and above such a layer common standards contribute to interoperation, while below the layer translation is used.<br/>As a practical matter, real interoperation is achieved by the definition and use of effective spanning layers.<br/>This will make two stacks of two protocols each.<br/>The inter-network protocol will communicate with each of the base protocol in their simpler language.<br/>For example, this interface level would define how TCP/IP transport software would talk to the network interface controller.<br/>Each higher layer adds additional capabilities.<br/>An inter-network protocol is required to connect them.<br/><br/>",

peaceful.<br/>Magellan called the ocean Pac\u00edfico (or \"Pacific\" meaning, \"peaceful\") because, after sailing through the stormy seas off Cape Horn, the expedition found calm waters.<br/>The trade winds in the southern and eastern Pacific are remarkably steady while conditions in the North Pacific are far more varied with, for example, cold winter temperatures on the east coast of Russia contrasting with the milder weather off British Columbia during the winter months due to the preferred flow of ocean currents.<br/>however, the Pacific is not always peaceful.<br/>To Magellan, it seemed much more calm (pacific) than the Atlantic.<br/>When the ITCZ is positioned north or south of the Equator, these directions change according to the Coriolis effect imparted by Earth's

device which isolates a narrow band of frequencies from a broader-bandwidth source is called a monochromator, even though the bandwidth is often explicitly specified, and thus a collection of frequencies is understood.<br/>In computer terms, this is often called greyscale.<br/>Images using only shades of grey (with or without black or white) are called grayscale or black-and-white.<br/>A monochrome computer display is able to display only a single color, often green, amber, red or white, and often also shades of that color.<br/>Even very controlled sources such as lasers operate in a range of frequencies (known as the spectral linewidth).<br/>The weighting of individual channels may be selected to achieve a desired artistic effect.<br/>A monochromatic object or image reflects colors in shades of limited colors or hues.<br/>The selection of weighting thus allows a wide range of artistic expression in the final monochromatic image.<br/>Infrared

catenary arch has a different shape from the parabolic arch.<br/>The three-hinged arch is not only hinged at its base, like the two-hinged arch, yet also at its apex.<br/>The additional apical connection allows the three-hinged arch to move in two opposite directions and compensate for any expansion and contraction.<br/>These are common as decorative treatments of a wall surface in many architectural styles, especially Romanesque architecture.<br/>The two-hinged arch is most often used to bridge long spans.<br/>The many forms of arch are classified into three categories: circular, pointed, and parabolic.<br/>Some rock balance sculptures are in the form of an arch.<br/>Old arches sometimes need reinforcement due to decay of the keystones, forming what is known as bald

countersunk into recesses in the corners of the glass panels allowing strengthened panes to appear unsupported creating a flush exterior.<br/>Modern multi-story buildings are frequently constructed with curtain walls made almost entirely of glass.<br/>Soda-lime sheet glass is typically used as transparent glazing material, typically as windows in external walls of buildings.<br/>The most common and oldest applications of glass in optics are as lenses, windows, mirrors, and prisms.<br/>The tendency for a material to form a glass while quenched is called glass-forming ability.<br/>Container glass for common bottles and jars is formed by blowing and pressing methods.<br/>Other uses of glass in tableware include decanters, jugs, plates, and bowls.<br/>Instead, glass manufacturing processes in the past produced sheets of non-uniform thickness leading to observed sagging and ripples in old windows.<br/>Some objects, such as drinking glasses and eyeglasses, are so commonly made of

into use to refer to the main film presented in a cinema and the one which was promoted or advertised.<br/>The film processing lab Technicolor developed the Three-Tone coloring technique that became the standard for color film.<br/>The term feature film originally referred to the main, full-length film in a cinema program that also included a short film and often a newsreel.<br/>One of the early adopters of the three-strip process was Disney.<br/>The term was used to distinguish the longer film from the short films (referred to as shorts) typically presented before the main film, such as newsreels, serials, animated cartoons, live-action comedies, and documentaries.<br/>The latter starring actor Frederick Warde starred in some of these movie adaptations.<br/>In 1900, the documentary

Clinton on CBS's 60 Minutes.<br/><br/><strong>saba banana</strong><strong>: </strong>In some South American countries, the name tostones is used to describe this food when prepared at home and also plantain chips (mentioned above), which are typically purchased from a store.<br/>The following table shows the nutrient content of raw plantain and major staple foods.<br/>The term \"plantain\" is loosely applied to any banana cultivar that is usually cooked before it is eaten.<br/>The chips are typically labeled \"plantain chips\" when they are made of green plantains that taste starchy, like potato chips.<br/>Saba bananas) belong to the ABB Group.<br/>Plantains are used in the Ivory Coast dish aloco as the main ingredient.<br/>The Philippine version uses chunks of saba bananas.<br/>Boli is the term used for roasted plantain in Nigeria.<br/>In botanical usage, the term \"plantain\" is used only for true plantains, while other starchy cultivars used for cooking are called \"cooking bananas\".<br/>Tostones in the Dominican Republic are only fried once and are thicker than chips.<br/><br/><strong>the phrase</strong><strong>: </strong>There is a difference between the common use of the term phrase and its technical use in linguistics.<br/>In grammatical analysis, most phrases contain a key word that identifies the type and linguistic features of the phrase.<br/>in this case the phrase may be described as having a \"null determiner\".<br/>The head noun picture has the four dependents the, old, of Fred, and that I found in the drawer.<br/>The common use of the term \"phrase\" is different from that employed by some phrase structure theories of syntax.<br/>Traditionally, a phrase is understood to contain two or more words.<br/>Trees show the words, phrases, and, at times, clauses that make up sentences.<br/>this is known as the head-word, or the head.<br/>) This concept of the phrase is a source of confusion for students of syntax.<br/>Almost every sentence contains at

literary theory, critics find complications in the term author beyond what constitutes authorship in a legal setting.<br/>They warn of the dangers interpretations could suffer from when associating the subject of inherently meaningful words and language with the personality of one authorial voice.<br/>Cannon enjoyed making the film and compared the experience to \"being on a cruise\".<br/>They attend the opening night of the play and film ends with them reading a positive review of the play in The New York Times.<br/>Barthes challenges the idea that a text can be attributed to any single author.<br/>The more specific phrase published author refers to an author (especially but not necessarily of books) whose work has been independently accepted for publication by a reputable publisher,

lemons, oranges, and strawberries.<br/>In all these examples, the fruit develops from a single flower with numerous pistils.<br/>Combating this pest without the use of harmful pesticides is an active area of research.<br/><br/><strong>william sydney porter</strong><strong>: </strong>He holed up in a Trujillo hotel, where he wrote Cabbages and Kings, in which he coined the term \"banana republic\" to qualify the country, a phrase subsequently used widely to describe a small, unstable tropical nation in Latin America with a narrowly focused, agrarian economy.<br/>It was during these New Orleans days that I adopted my pen name of O.<br/>A newspaper once wrote and asked me what the O stands for.<br/>He gave various explanations for the origin of his pen name.<br/>Henry had a gift for creating descriptions with economy and grace.<br/>Porter's legacy includes the O.<br/>He changed the spelling of his middle name to Sydney in 1898.<br/>The episode garnering the most critical acclaim was \"The Cop and the Anthem\" starring Charles Laughton and Marilyn Monroe.<br/>We looked down the list and my eye lighted on the name Henry, \"That'll do for a last name,\" said I.<br/>The essential premise of this story has been copied, re-worked, parodied, and otherwise re-told countless times in the century since it was written.<br/><br/><strong>banana</strong><strong>: </strong>This use, often

the meme went viral on social media in support of him.<br/><br/><strong>coin</strong><strong>: </strong>The fact that the Greek word \"Phanes\" also means light (or lamp), and the word \"sema\" also means tomb makes this coin a famous and controversial one.<br/>The Japanese government in response produced a circulatory coin with a holographic image.<br/>Some coins employed a visual pun: some coins from Rhodes featured a rose, since the Greek word for rose is rhodon.<br/>The subject was a colored poppy on the reverse of a 25-cent piece minted through a patented process.<br/>Coins often have images, numerals, or text on them.<br/>In this usage, obverse means the front face of the object and reverse means the back face.<br/>A number of these tokens are in the collection of the National Museum of Australia.<br/>The coins were defaced, smoothed and inscribed, either by stippling or engraving, with sometimes touching words of loss.<br/>, the axis passing from one face of the coin to the other) before coming to an abrupt stop.<br/>Most of these coins are also non-circular, with different shapes corresponding to different coin values.<br/><br/><strong>this item</strong><strong>: </strong>Although the origin of the term \"item number\" is obscure, it is likely that it derives its meaning from objectification of women.<br/>The re-created version by Tanishk Bagchi features Middle-Eastern musical sounds.<br/>Baz Luhrmann's 2001 film musical, Moulin Rouge! used a westernized version of this song.<br/>In Krazzy 4, Hrithik Roshan has an item number during the end credits.<br/>She was featured in \"Chamma Chamma\" in the 1998 film China Gate.<br/>The term is commonly used within Indian films (Hindi, Kannada, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam and Bengali) to describe a catchy, upbeat, often sexually provocative dance sequence for a song in a movie.<br/>It is a recreation of the song \"Laila O Laila\" from the 1980 film Qurbani, which featured actress Zeenat Aman with Feroz Khan in the original musical number.<br/>Although there have been many songs that fit the descriptions of item numbers in the early and mid-1990s, the term itself was coined when Shilpa Shetty danced for \"Main Aai Hoon UP Bihar Lootne\" in the movie Shool.<br/>Such songs provided the necessary settings for the lead couple's love to bloom.<br/>All pages with titles containing Item.<br/><br/><strong>the word republic</strong><strong>: </strong>Beyond these basic definitions, the word republic has a number of other connotations.<br/>To describe non-monarchical states writers, most importantly Leonardo Bruni, adopted the Latin phrase res publica.<br/>The term republic originated from the writers of the Renaissance as a descriptive term for states that were not monarchies.<br/>Modern scholars note the word democracy at the time of the 3rd century BC and later suffered from degradation and could mean any autonomous state, no matter how oligarchic in nature.<br/>However, the term republic is not synonymous with the republican form.<br/>They used terms such as libertas populi, a free people, to describe the states.<br/>While Bruni and Machiavelli used the term to describe the states of Northern Italy, which were not monarchies, the term res publica has a set of interrelated meanings in the original Latin.<br/>Likewise, in Polish the term was translated as rzeczpospolita, although the translation is now only used with respect to Poland.<br/>At its core, the literal meaning of the word republic when used to reference a form of government means: \"a country that is governed by elected representatives and by an elected leader (such as a president) rather than by a king or queen\".<br/>Paul Adams observes that republic is most often used in the United States as a synonym for \"state\" or \"government,\" but with more positive connotations than either of those terms.<br/><br/><strong>yellow banana</strong><strong>: </strong>This use, often accompanied with the text \"banana for scale\", became an internet meme.<br/>This has elicited the expression Banana Pancake Trail for those places in Asia that cater to these travelers.<br/>Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan created a concept art piece titled Comedian involving taping a banana to a wall using silver duct tape.<br/>The word banana is thought to be of West

name kalium for potassium, with the chemical symbol \"K\".<br/>The \"Gold Book\" of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry has designated the official chemical symbol as K.<br/>When Humphry Davy first isolated the pure element using electrolysis in 1807, he named it potassium, which he derived from the word potash.<br/>The English name for the element potassium comes from the word \"potash\", which refers to an early method of extracting various potassium salts: placing in a pot the ash of burnt wood or tree leaves, adding water, heating, and evaporating the solution.<br/>It adopts a face-centered cubic structure.<br/>The English and French speaking countries adopted Davy and Gay-Lussac/Th\u00e9nard's name Potassium, while the Germanic countries adopted Gilbert/Klaproth's name Kalium.<br/>Potassium was the first metal that was isolated by electrolysis.<br/>Megatons of these compounds are produced annually.<br/>Minerals are dated by measurement of the concentration of potassium and the amount of radiogenic 40Ar that has accumulated.<br/>Glass manufacturers use granular potash as a flux, lowering the temperature at which a mixture melts.<br/><br/><strong>bananas</strong><strong>: </strong>This use, often accompanied with the text \"banana for scale\", became an internet meme.<br/>This has elicited the expression Banana Pancake

version of Play School for many years accompanied by an animation depicting pairs of bananas in blue-and-white striped pyjamas.<br/>Since then the song has been rerecorded several times and has been particularly popular during banana shortages.<br/>In internet culture, bananas are sometimes included in images as a reference for the size of other objects in the image.<br/><br/><strong>south america</strong><strong>: </strong>In Dutch, the word Amerika mostly refers to the United States.<br/>In French the word am\u00e9ricain may be used for things relating to the Americas.<br/>There are no alternative words to distinguish between things relating to the United States or to the Americas.<br/>A two-dimensional globe created by Martin Waldseem\u00fcller was the earliest recorded use of the term.<br/>The name America was first recorded in 1507.<br/>The adjective Amerikaans is most often used for things or people relating to the United States.<br/>They established the Muisca Confederation of many clans, or cacicazgos, that had a free trade network among themselves.<br/>The name was also used (together with the related term Amerigen) in the Cosmographiae Introductio, apparently written by Matthias Ringmann, in reference to South America.<br/>However, without a clarifying context, singular America in English commonly refers to the United States of America.<br/>The feminine form America accorded with the feminine names of Asia, Africa, and Europa.<br/><br/>", "concept": "<strong>saba banana</strong><strong>: </strong><br/><br/><strong>william sydney

the lamp is around 0.<br/>The inner surface of the lamp is coated with a fluorescent coating made of varying blends of metallic and rare-earth phosphor salts.<br/>For example, some people find the color rendition produced by some fluorescent lamps to be harsh and displeasing.<br/>An electric discharge in the tube causes the mercury atoms to emit mostly ultraviolet light.<br/>The spectrum of light emitted from a fluorescent lamp is the combination of light directly emitted by the mercury vapor, and light emitted by the phosphorescent coating.<br/>The extra energy used to start a fluorescent lamp is equivalent to a few seconds of normal operation.<br/>The relative intensity of light emitted in each narrow band of wavelengths over the visible spectrum is in different proportions compared to that of an incandescent source.<br/>The life expectancy of a fluorescent lamp is primarily limited by the life of the cathode electrodes.<br/>New fluorescent lamps may show a twisting spiral pattern of light in a part of the lamp.<br/>If a fluorescent lamp is broken, a very small amount of mercury can contaminate the surrounding environment.<br/><br/><strong>electrical</strong><strong>: </strong>A succession of sparks jumping from the key to the back of his hand showed that lightning was indeed electrical in nature.<br/>While this method, now known as the triboelectric effect, can lift light objects and generate sparks, it is extremely inefficient.<br/>A current was allowed through a wire suspended from a pivot above the magnet and dipped into the mercury.<br/>The induced voltage is proportional to the time rate of change of the current.<br/>The resistive Joule heating effect employed in filament light bulbs also sees more direct use in electric heating.<br/>The level of electromagnetic emissions generated by electric arcing is high enough to produce electromagnetic interference, which can be detrimental to the workings of adjacent equipment.<br/>A lightweight ball suspended from a string can be charged by touching it with a glass rod that has itself been charged by rubbing with a cloth.<br/>The pain caused by an electric shock can be intense, leading electricity at times to be employed as a method of torture.<br/>The voltage of a large lightning cloud may be as high as 100 MV and have discharge energies as great as 250 kWh.<br/>The rapid expansion in electrical technology at this time transformed industry and society, becoming a driving force for the Second Industrial Revolution.<br/><br/><strong>sunset</strong><strong>: </strong>Sometimes just before sunrise or after sunset a green flash can be seen.<br/>The high altitude clouds serve to reflect strongly reddened sunlight still striking the stratosphere after sunset, down to the surface.<br/>Its width is unaltered, so the disk appears wider than it is high.<br/>The remaining reddened sunlight can then be scattered by cloud droplets and other relatively large particles to light up the horizon red and orange.<br/>The colors of the Martian sunset differ from those on Earth.<br/>Some of the most varied colors at sunset can be found in the opposite or eastern sky after the Sun has set during twilight.<br/>Further, because the light from the Sun is refracted as it passes through the Earth's atmosphere, the Sun is still visible after it is geometrically below the horizon.<br/>Light from the bottom edge of the Sun's disk is refracted more than light from the top, since refraction increases as the angle of elevation decreases.<br/>Refraction also affects the apparent shape of the Sun when it is very close to the horizon.<br/>It makes things appear higher in the sky than they really are.<br/><br/><strong>blonde hair</strong><strong>: </strong>The pigmentation of both hair and eyes is lightest around the Baltic Sea, and darkness increases regularly and almost concentrically around this region.<br/>The traces of hair color on Greek korai probably reflect the colors the artists saw in natural hair.<br/>A typical explanation found in the scientific literature for the evolution of light hair is related to the evolution of light skin, and in turn the requirement for vitamin D synthesis and northern Europe's seasonally reduced solar radiation.<br/>In medieval Gothic paintings of

delivered by a caller.<br/>Bird call, part of a bird song.<br/>An infamous blown call in Game Six of the 1985 World Series by Major League Baseball umpire Don Denkinger.<br/>Call, in the game of

photographs recorded with infrared-sensitive passive (non-IR emitting) equipment, the eyes (not only the pupils) usually appear very bright.<br/>Photographs taken with infrared light through night vision devices always show very bright pupils because, in the dark, the pupils are fully dilated and the infrared light is not absorbed by any ocular pigment.<br/>Theatrical followspot operators, positioned nearly coincidentally with a very bright light and somewhat distant from the actors, occasionally witness red-eye in actors on stage.<br/>In flash photography the light of the flash occurs too fast for the pupil to close, so much of the very bright light from the flash passes into the eye through the pupil, reflects off the fundus at the back of the eyeball and out through the pupil.<br/>The effect is not visible to the rest of the audience because it is reliant on the very small angle between the followspot operator and the light.<br/>When a bright light source is shining on the lens but not in its field of view, lens flare appears as a haze that washes out the image and reduces contrast.<br/>here, the reflected red light is directly visible through the ophthalmoscope.<br/>The light enters the eye in a direction away from the optical axis of the camera and is refocused by the eye lens back along the same axis.<br/>In a photograph of a child's face, if there is red-eye in one eye but not the other, it may be leukocoria, which may be caused by the cancer retinoblastoma.<br/>The amount of red light emerging from the pupil depends on the amount of melanin in the layers behind the retina.<br/><br/><strong>sun</strong><strong>: </strong>Only a very small fraction of the incident light is reflected.<br/>The brightness of the Sun can cause pain from looking at it with the naked eye.<br/>The flash is caused by light from the Sun just below the horizon being bent (usually through a temperature inversion) towards the observer.<br/>The change in opacity is due to the decreasing amount of H\u2212 ions, which absorb visible light easily.<br/>The sunlight that is destined for the eyepiece is reflected from an unsilvered surface of a piece of glass.<br/>The chromosphere, transition region, and corona are much hotter than the surface of the Sun.<br/>Simple filters made of darkened glass allow the full intensity of sunlight to pass through if they break, endangering the observer's eyesight.<br/>The high temperature of the corona shows that it is heated by something other than direct heat conduction from the photosphere.<br/>Photons produced in this layer escape the Sun through the transparent solar atmosphere above it and become solar radiation, sunlight.<br/>Humanity's most fundamental understanding of the Sun is as the luminous disk in the sky, whose presence above the horizon creates day and whose absence causes night.<br/><br/><strong>lamp</strong><strong>: </strong>The pressure inside the lamp is around 0.<br/>The inner surface of the lamp is coated with a fluorescent coating made of varying blends of metallic and rare-earth phosphor salts.<br/>For example, some people find the color rendition produced by some fluorescent lamps to be harsh and displeasing.<br/>The spectrum of light emitted from a fluorescent lamp is the combination of light directly emitted by the mercury vapor, and light emitted by the phosphorescent coating.<br/>The extra energy used to start a fluorescent lamp is equivalent to a few seconds of normal operation.<br/>The relative intensity of light emitted in each narrow band of wavelengths over the visible spectrum is in different proportions compared to that of an incandescent source.<br/>The life expectancy of a fluorescent lamp is primarily limited by the life of the cathode electrodes.<br/>New fluorescent lamps may show a twisting spiral pattern of light in a part of the lamp.<br/>If a fluorescent lamp is broken, a very small amount of mercury can contaminate the surrounding environment.<br/>Capacitive coupling with high-voltage power lines can light a lamp continuously at low intensity, depending on the intensity of the electric field, as shown in the image on the right.<br/><br/><strong>the girls head</strong><strong>: </strong>The co-educational schools in the APS are still allowed to enter boats in this regatta.<br/>There is a much

dose from these tests has decreased to only 0.<br/>Background radiation doses in the immediate vicinity of particles of high atomic number materials, within the human body, have a small enhancement due to the photoelectric effect.<br/>Background (astronomy), small amounts of light coming from otherwise dark parts of the sky.<br/>About 100,000 Bq/m3 of radon was found in Stanley Watras's basement in 1984.<br/>This radiation is much more intense in the upper troposphere, around 10 km altitude, and is thus of particular concern for airline crews and frequent passengers, who spend many hours per year in this environment.<br/>Some of this contamination is local, rendering the immediate surroundings highly radioactive, while some of it is carried longer distances as nuclear fallout.<br/>This dose is not readily comparable to the radiation protection limits, since the latter deal with whole body doses, while the dose from smoking is delivered to a very small portion of the body.<br/>However, many of their daughter products are strong gamma emitters.<br/>Most of the natural neutron background is a product of cosmic rays interacting with the atmosphere.<br/>Terrestrial

animals have grasping appendages similar in form to a hand such as paws, claws, and talons, but these are not scientifically considered to be grasping hands.<br/>The thumb is undoubtedly the \"master digit\" of the hand, giving value to all the other fingers.<br/>Apes and monkeys are sometimes described as having four hands, because the toes are long and the hallux is opposable and looks more like a thumb, thus enabling the feet to be used as hands.<br/>The fingers may be fused in a disorder known as syndactyly.<br/>There is a hypothesis suggesting the form of the modern human hand is especially conducive to the formation of a compact fist, presumably for fighting purposes.<br/>There are several cutaneous conditions that can affect the hand including the nails.<br/>The scientific use of the term hand in this sense to distinguish the terminations of the front paws from the hind ones is an example of anthropomorphism.<br/>In humans, the big toe is thus more derived than the thumb.<br/>The thumb has one long flexor and a short flexor in the thenar muscle group.<br/><br/><strong>street sign</strong><strong>: </strong>The city eventually gave up on a metal sign and painted

for propulsion.<br/>Similarly to propeller vehicles, some vehicles use wings for propulsion.<br/>Most vehicles, with the notable exception of railed vehicles, have at least one steering mechanism.<br/>Screw-propelled vehicles are propelled by auger-like cylinders fitted with helical flanges.<br/>Examples of vehicles using continuous track are tanks, snowmobiles and

displays a white background with red letters and a red merrowed border.<br/>The primary visual identification of a member of an outlaw motorcycle club is the vest adorned with a large club-specific patch or patches, predominantly located in the middle of the back.<br/>The number and arrangement of patches is somewhat indicative of the nature of the club.<br/>The colors worn by members of some

style is the recumbent bicycle.<br/>The \"dandy horse\", also called Draisienne or Laufmaschine, was the first human means of transport to use only two wheels in tandem and was invented by the German Baron Karl von Drais.<br/>Its rider sat astride a wooden frame supported by two in-line wheels and pushed the vehicle along with his or her feet while steering the front wheel.<br/>A twin-chain system

for use in motor scooters.<br/>A four-door station wagon model called the Civic Shuttle (also Civic Pro in Japan) was available from 1984 until 1991 (this brand name would later be revived for the mid-1990s Honda Shuttle people carrier, known in some markets as the Honda Stream).<br/>The vehicle itself does not emit any pollutants and its only by-products are heat and water.<br/>The all-electric Honda EV Plus was introduced in 1997 as a result of CARB's zero-emissions vehicle mandate and was available only for leasing in California.<br/>The company combines participation in motorcycle races throughout the world with the development of high-potential racing machines.<br/><br/><strong>whelle</strong><strong>: </strong>Two new 150HL tanks were installed.<br/>Some of the following are seasonal, or brewed only occasionally.<br/>By 2011, the volume of sales required the company to expand its brewing capacity.<br/>The brewery's architecture is an homage to the traditional Oast house, the farm building used for drying hops in preparation for the brewing processOver the years the company has won numerous awards for its products, at events such as the Canadian Brewing Awards, the Ontario Brewing Awards and the U.<br/>In January 2013, four more tanks were installed to keep up with demand for Wellington products.<br/>The company also has a distribution warehouse in Toronto.<br/>Traditionally, this craft beer was sold in bottles, but recently, the company has increased the use of cans to meet the growing public demand for this type of beer container.<br/>At that time, the company employed a staff of 45.<br/>The Wellington beers are brewed in small batches with natural ingredients and uses no cold filtration, natural carbonation, no

used to make helmets in the 21st century include aramid, such as Kevlar and Twaron.<br/>In this case, a pith helmet can be made out of cork, fibrous, or similar material.<br/>Some of the helmets were printed with a camouflage pattern.<br/>In the narrow definition, a pith helmet is technically a type of sun helmet made out of pith material.<br/>Whatever the material, the pith helmet is designed to shade the wearer's head and face from the sun.<br/>Since the 1990s, most helmets are made from resin or plastic, which may be reinforced with fibers such as aramids.<br/>This helmet is mostly made in Vietnam, where the design was inherited from French colonial patterns.<br/>In the early days of the automobile, some motorists also adopted this style of headgear, and early football helmets were also made of leather.<br/>Imperial Guard units serving in the Korean War often wore these helmets when not in combat.<br/>The two main producers of the US military fiber pressed pith helmet were the International Hat Company and Hawley Products Company.<br/><br/><strong>polyester</strong><strong>: </strong>The futuro house was made of fibreglass-reinforced polyester plastic.<br/>Nearly 70 million barrels of oil are used each year to make polyester around the world, which is now the most commonly used fiber in making clothes.<br/>Polyesters are also used in anchor bolt adhesives though epoxy

the following table, the main applications of textile and packaging of polyester are listed.<br/>The following figure gives an overview over such typical polycondensation reactions for polyester production.<br/>According to this table, the world's total polyester production might exceed 50 million tons per annum before the year 2010.<br/>In the following table, the estimated world polyester production is shown.<br/>The material is used extensively in clothing.<br/>This type of resin is known as a Nadic resin and is referred to as a poor man's Ortho, due to sharing many similar properties of an Ortho resin along with the extremely low cost of DCPD raw material.<br/><br/><strong>helmet</strong><strong>: </strong>Some types of synthetic fibers used to make helmets in the 21st century include aramid, such as Kevlar and Twaron.<br/>Since the 1990s, most helmets are made from resin or plastic, which may be reinforced with fibers such as aramids.<br/>In the early days of the automobile, some motorists also adopted this style of headgear, and early football helmets were also made of leather.<br/>Modern helmets have a much wider range of applications, including helmets adapted to the specific needs of many athletic pursuits and work environments, and these helmets very often incorporate plastics and other synthetic materials for their light weight and shock absorption capabilities.<br/>During the Middle Ages, many different military helmets and some ceremonial helmets were developed, almost all being metal.<br/>Race car helmets include a head and neck support system that keeps the helmet (and head) attached to the body in severe collisions.<br/>More specifically, a helmet complements the skull in protecting the human brain.<br/>Some British gamekeepers during the 18th and 19th centuries wore helmets made of straw bound together with cut bramble.<br/>The greatest expansion in the variety of forms and composition of helmets, however, took place in the 20th century, with the development of highly specialized helmets for a multitude of athletic and professional applications, as well as the advent of modern plastics.<br/>Two important helmet types to develop in antiquity were the Corinthian helmet and the Roman galea.<br/><br/><strong>plastic</strong><strong>: </strong>One important classification of plastics is the degree to which the chemical processes used to make them are reversible or not.<br/>The solid rocket propellant used to fuel the Space Shuttle solid rocket booster employs HTPB, a synthetic rubber, as a non-energetic secondary fuel.<br/>Almost 90% of polymer plasticizers, most commonly phthalate esters, are used in PVC, giving this material improved flexibility and durability.<br/>The noun plasticity refers specifically here to the deformability of the materials used in the manufacture of plastics.<br/>While a finished plastic may be non-toxic, the monomers used in the manufacture of its parent polymers may be toxic.<br/>Here are some energetic plasticizers used in rocket propellants and smokeless powders:.<br/>The vast majority of these polymers are formed from chains of carbon atoms, with or without the attachment of oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur atoms.<br/>Meanwhile, 50% to 80% of debris in marine areas is plastic.<br/>In the medical field, polymer implants and other medical devices are derived at least partially from plastic.<br/>Futuro houses are made of fiberglass-reinforced polyesters, polyester-polyurethane, and PMMA.<br/><br/><strong>leather</strong><strong>: </strong>It is the material most commonly used in bullwhips.<br/>Kangaroo leather is used to make items that must be strong and flexible.<br/>Furniture and footwear are often made from full-grain leather.<br/>The production of the PVC used in the production of many artificial leathers requires a plasticizer called a phthalate to make it flexible and soft.<br/>Other animals mentioned below only constitute a fraction of a percent of total leather production.<br/>Many different methods for the manufacture of imitation leathers have been developed.<br/>The amount of leather fibers in the mix varies from 10% to 90%, affecting the properties of the product.<br/>For example, leather shoes bear a label that identifies the animal from which the leather came.<br/>A fermentation method of making collagen, the main chemical in real leather, is under development.<br/>However, there are environmental concerns with this tanning method, as chromium is a heavy metal.<br/><br/><strong>background</strong><strong>: </strong>An example of this is a scintillation detector used for surface contamination monitoring.<br/>The Limited Test Ban Treaty of 1963 prohibited above-ground tests, thus by the year 2000 the worldwide dose from these tests has decreased to only 0.<br/>Instruments used for radiation measurement include the Geiger\u2013M\u00fcller tube and the Scintillation detector.<br/>The increase in background radiation due to these tests peaked in 1963 at about 0.<br/>The average dose from the Three Mile Island accident was 0.<br/>The highest background radiation in an inhabited area is found in Ramsar, primarily due to the use of local naturally radioactive limestone as a building material.<br/>The production of these nuclides varies slightly with short-term variations in solar cosmic ray flux, but is considered practically constant over long scales of thousands to millions of years.<br/>The constant production, incorporation into organisms and relatively short half-life of carbon-14 are the principles used in radiocarbon dating of ancient biological materials, such as wooden artifacts or human remains.<br/>Note that the values quoted here are in Grays.<br/>Radon seeps out of these ores into the atmosphere or into ground water or infiltrates into buildings.<br/><br/><strong>sports gear</strong><strong>: </strong>As football remains the most popular sport in the 21st century, the material of the ball has completely changed over the centuries.<br/>A different type of net is used for various forms of fishing.<br/>Volleyball knee pads: Volleyball knee pads, is the equipment used by volleyball players to protect their knees, when they jump high, jump sideways and fall to the ground.<br/>from being made out of animal skin, to being lined with multiple layers of polyester or cotton.<br/>Sporting equipment can be used as protective gear or a tool used to help the athletes play the sport.<br/>The usage and development of protective gear in sports has evolved through time, and continues to advance over time.<br/>Football leggings: Football leggings, mostly used in winter.<br/>Football captains are chosen by the coach, the accessory provided must be worn by the captain.<br/>In other cases, the name of the sport is indicated, just as the cricket ball, golf ball, lacrosse ball or tennis ball.<br/>Tennis hat: The tennis hat is often used by tennis athletes.<br/><br/><strong>man</strong><strong>: </strong>The Parsons model was used to contrast and illustrate extreme positions on gender roles.<br/>Another significant hormone in sexual differentiation is the anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone, which inhibits the development of the M\u00fcllerian ducts.<br/>The actual determining factor is the SRY gene, which is normally found on the Y chromosome.<br/>While the outward signs of masculinity look different in different cultures, there are some common aspects to its definition across cultures.<br/>sometimes the word \"piece\" is defined to exclude pawns.<br/>This difference in the relative amounts of these sex steroids is largely responsible for the physiological differences that distinguish men from women.<br/>Secondary sexual characteristics that are specific to men include:.<br/>In mammals, the hormones that influence sexual differentiation and development are androgens (mainly testosterone), which stimulate later development of the ovary.<br/>This difference in the relative amounts of these sex steroids is responsible for the physiological differences that distinguish men from women.<br/>Although in general men suffer from many of the same illnesses as women, they suffer from slightly more illnesses in comparison to women.<br/><br/>", "concept": "<strong>name</strong><strong>: </strong>a name is used to

have to work.<br/>In many cultures, a child is considered an adult after undergoing a rite of passage, which may or may not correspond to the time of puberty.<br/>In Roman times, children were regarded as not culpable for crimes, a position later adopted by the Church.<br/>Children from low income families are less likely to have access to books and computers which would enhance their development.<br/>During the European Renaissance, artistic depictions of children increased dramatically, which did not affect the social attitude to children much, however.<br/>Upon the entrance of school, mental disorders that would normally not be noticed come to light.<br/>In the 19th century, children younger than seven years old were believed incapable of crime.<br/>This change can be traced in paintings: In the Middle Ages, children were portrayed in art as miniature adults with no childlike characteristics.<br/>A right to education has been recognized by some governments.<br/>The age limit of voluntary/involuntary military service is also disputed at the international level.<br/><br/><strong>toddler</strong><strong>: </strong>The toddler is discovering that they are a separate being from their parent and are testing their boundaries in learning the way the world around them works.<br/>Along with self recognition comes feelings of embarrassment and pride that the child had not previously experienced.<br/>Toddlers tend to have temper tantrums because they have such strong emotions but do not know how to express themselves the way that older children and adults do.<br/>The mattress in a toddler bed is often the same size as that in an infant bed.<br/>At this age, children are becoming very proficient at conveying their wants and needs to their parents in a verbal fashion.<br/>There are several other important milestones that are achieved in this time period that parents tend not to emphasize as much as walking and talking.<br/>A toddler bed is low to the ground to facilitate safe and easy entry and exit for the occupant.<br/>Child plays alongside other children but not with them.<br/>Young children squat instinctively as a continuous movement from standing up whenever they want to lower themselves to ground level.<br/>Self-awareness is another milestone that helps parents understand how a toddler is reacting.<br/><br/><strong>boy</strong><strong>: </strong>A boy's first ejaculation is an important milestone in his development.<br/>A boy's muscles increase in size and mass, his voice deepens, his

a boy's erect penis becomes capable of ejaculating semen and impregnating a female.<br/>Historically, in the United States and South Africa, \"boy\" was not only a \"neutral\" term for domestics but also a disparaging term towards black men.<br/>The foreskin of some boys' penises is removed in a process known as circumcision.<br/>\"Sex selection in China sees 117 boys born for every 100

Barlas patriarchal behaviour among Muslims is based in an ideology which jumbles sexual and biological differences with gender dualisms and inequality.<br/>The other one is a solar calendar officially used in Iran and Afghanistan.<br/>Islamic states have adopted Islam as the ideological foundation of state and constitution.<br/>In Afghanistan, seminaries are operated by politically active religious organizations and have taken the place of basic education not provided and funded by the government.<br/>Another figure from the Islamic Golden Age, Avicenna, also founded his own Avicennism school of philosophy, which was influential in both Islamic and Christian lands.<br/>Riada Asimovic Akyol further says that equality for Muslim women needs to be achieved through self-criticism.<br/>In those countries, the legal code is largely secular.<br/>In addition, the average of years of schooling in countries where Muslims are the majority is 6.<br/><br/><strong>this boy</strong><strong>:

</strong>Giving him some elementary spiritual precepts picked up here and there, he made a mark with saffron on his forehead, which is called qashqa in the idiom of the Hindus and which they consider lucky.<br/>When we think of the Hindu religion, unlike other religions in the world, the Hindu religion does not claim any one prophet.<br/>Inden states that this practice means different things to different Hindus, and has been misunderstood, misrepresented as idolatry, and various rationalisations have been constructed by both Western and native Indologists.<br/>A specific law, contentious between Hindu nationalists and their opponents in India, relates to the legal age of marriage for girls.<br/>The term 'Hindu' in these ancient records is an ethno-geographical term and did not refer to a religion.<br/>Thus, the Supreme Court was forced to consider the question whether Jainism is part of Hinduism in 2005 and 2006.<br/>The historical meaning of the term Hindu has evolved with time.<br/>One need not be religious in the minimal sense, states Julius Lipner, to be accepted as Hindu by Hindus, or to describe oneself as Hindu.<br/>The Punjab region, called Sapta Sindhu in the Vedas, is called Hapta Hindu in Zend Avesta.<br/>Muslim clerics consider this proposal as unacceptable because under the shariah-derived personal law, a Muslim girl can be married at any age after she reaches puberty.<br/><br/><strong>his birthday</strong><strong>: </strong>In North Korea, people do not celebrate birthdays on July 8 and December 17 because these were the dates of the deaths of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il, respectively.<br/>Origen in his commentary \"On Levites\" writes that Christians should not only refrain from celebrating their birthdays, but should look on them with disgust.<br/>Some Muslims migrating to the United States adopt the custom of celebrating birthdays, especially for children, but others resist.<br/>In Ghana, on their birthday, children wake up to a special treat called \"oto\" which is a patty made from mashed sweet potato and eggs fried in palm oil.<br/>The Lubavitcher Rebbe encouraged people to celebrate their birthdays, by gathering friends, making positive resolutions, and through various religious observances.<br/>In many parts of the world an individual's birthday is celebrated by a party where a specially made cake, usually decorated with lettering and the person's age, is presented.<br/>Some Muslim especially from Salafi school of thought oppose the celebration of a birthday as a sin, as it is considered an \"innovation\" of the faith, or bi'dah while other clerics have issued statements saying that the celebration of a birthday is permissible.<br/>In Korea, many celebrate a traditional ceremony of Baek-il (Feast for the 100th day) and Doljanchi (child's first birthday).<br/>In Judaism, the perspective on birthday celebrations is disputed by various rabbis, although today it is accepted practice by most of the faithful.<br/>As with Christmas, the dates of these celebrations are traditional and probably have no connection with the actual birthdays of these individuals.<br/><br/><strong>christianity</strong><strong>: </strong>Breviaries such as the Shehimo and Agpeya are used by Oriental Orthodox Christians to pray these canonical hours while facing in the eastward direction of prayer.<br/>Jesus' death and resurrection are commemorated by Christians in all worship services, with special emphasis during Holy Week, which includes Good Friday and Easter Sunday.<br/>The Catholic Church teaches that salvation does not occur without faithfulness on the part of Christians.<br/>The cross, today one of the most widely recognized symbols, was used by Christians from the earliest times.<br/>The term \"Protestant\" was not originally used by Reformation era leaders.<br/>There is a diversity of doctrines and liturgical practices among groups calling themselves Christian.<br/>It is also reported that Christianity is popular among people of different backgrounds in Africa and Aisa, according to a report by the Singapore Management University, more people in Southeast Asia are converting to Christianity, many of them are young and have a university degree.<br/>In most countries in the developed world, church attendance among people who continue to identify themselves as Christians has been falling over the last few decades.<br/>The position of Christians affected by Nazism is highly complex.<br/>\"The Trinity is an essential doctrine of mainstream Christianity.<br/><br/><strong>eating</strong><strong>: </strong>Traditional African cultural ideals are reflected in the practice of some health professionals.<br/>For humans, eating is an activity of daily living.<br/>Children as young as ages 5\u20137 are aware of the cultural messages regarding body image and dieting.<br/>For example, most of the Middle Eastern countries, eating while sitting on the floor is most common, and it is believed to be healthier than eating while sitting to a table.<br/>There is a cultural emphasis on thinness which is especially pervasive in western society.<br/>In the majority of many African communities, thinness is generally not seen as an ideal body type and most pressure to attain a slim figure may stem from influence or exposure to Western culture and ideology.<br/>In the past, the available evidence did not suggest that unhealthy weight loss methods and eating disordered behaviors are common in India as proven by stagnant rates of clinically diagnosed eating disorders.<br/>In jurisdictions under Sharia law, it may be proscribed for Muslim adults during the daylight hours of Ramadan.<br/>Newborn babies do not eat adult foods.<br/>in Ghana, pharmacists sell appetite stimulants to women who desire to, as Ghanaians stated, \u201cgrow fat\u201d.<br/><br/><strong>religion</strong><strong>: </strong>Nowadays these religions are practiced only by minorities.<br/>With rare exceptions, Christians do not consider the Old Testament's strict food laws as relevant for today's church.<br/>The term myth can be used pejoratively by both religious and non-religious people.<br/>Schizophrenic episodes are also experienced by people who do not have belief in gods.<br/>For example, the common Christian beliefs of Incarnation, Trinity, and the resurrection of Jesus are not accepted by Judaism or Islam (see for example Islamic view of Jesus' death).<br/>These two religions prohibit the consumption of pork.<br/>The Mandaeans do not worship the God of Abraham and they hate Abraham, considering him, along with Moses, Jesus and Muhammad, to be a false prophet.<br/>However, some foods not considered kosher are considered halal in Islam.<br/>Male circumcision is also widely practiced among Christians from South Korea, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Palestine, Israel, and North Africa.<br/>Parallel concepts are not found in many current and past cultures.<br/><br/><strong>people</strong><strong>: </strong>Outside the United States, criminal trials in Ireland and the Philippines are prosecuted in the name of the people of their respective states.<br/>The political theory underlying this format is that criminal prosecutions are brought in the name of the sovereign.<br/>In criminal law, in certain jurisdictions, criminal prosecutions are brought in the name of the People.<br/>Various states govern or claim to govern in the name of the people.<br/>In Wall's eyes, the party suffered from a lack of media attention and \"opposition from many environmentalists\", which contrasted the experience of other emerging Green parties, such as Germany's Die Gr\u00fcnen.<br/>states, the \"people\" are judged to be the sovereign, even as in the United Kingdom and other dependencies of the British Crown, criminal prosecutions are typically brought in the name of the Crown.<br/>Derek Wall, in his history of the Green Party, contends that the new political movement focused initially on the theme of survival, which shaped the \"bleak evolution\" of the nascent ecological party during the 1970s.<br/>A People's Republic is typically a Marxist or socialist one-party state that claims to govern on behalf of the people even if it in practice often turns out to be a dictatorship.<br/>This article inspired Whittaker and her husband Tony, a former Kenilworth councillor for the Conservative Party, to form a small group of professional and business people called 'Club of Thirteen', so named because it first met on 13 October 1972 in Daventry.<br/>After much debate, the party's 1975 conference adopted a proposal to change its name to the Ecology Party to gain more recognition as the party of environmental concern.<br/><br/><strong>christian</strong><strong>: </strong>The identification of Jesus as the Messiah is not accepted by Judaism.<br/>A wide range of beliefs and practices are found across the world among those who call themselves Christian.<br/>Where there is a distinction, Nasrani refers to people from a Christian culture and Masihi is used by Christians themselves for those with a religious faith in Jesus.<br/>For example, Timothy Beal notes the disparity of beliefs among those who identify as Christians in the United States as follows: Although all of them have their historical roots in Christian theology and tradition, and although most would identify themselves as Christian, many would not identify others within the larger category as Christian.<br/>In fact, the nearly 77 percent of Americans who self-identify as Christian are a diverse pluribus of Christianities that are far from any collective unity.<br/>In Indonesian language, the term \"Nasrani\" is also used alongside \"Kristen\".<br/>In some countries Nasrani tends to be used generically for non-Muslim Western foreigners.<br/>Denominations and sects disagree on a common definition of \"Christianity\".<br/>High birth rates and conversion were cited as the reason for Christian population growth.<br/>By 2050, the Christian population is expected to exceed 3 billion.<br/><br/>", "concept": "<strong>celebrate</strong><strong>: </strong>a spirit is used to celebrate<br/>a harmonica is used to celebrate<br/>a birthday makes you want to

heavily customized with decorative add-ons and performance-enhancing parts.<br/>In 1972 Mike Goodwin and Terry Tiernan, the president of the AMA, put on one of these stadium races in the Los Angeles Coliseum.<br/>A typical pit bike is usually a small dirt bike, but it has become common to be able to buy pit bikes with street-style wheels and tires.<br/>Freestyle Motocross (FMX), a relatively new variation of supercross started by the South African champion, Marco Urzi, does not involve racing and instead it concentrates on performing acrobatic stunts while jumping motocross bikes.<br/>A rider would buy a child's minibike, usually a Honda CRF 50 or Kawasaki KLX110, and apply all the necessary upgrades and modifications to build a competitive pit bike.<br/>The intense competition over rugged terrain led to technical improvements in motorcycles.<br/>During the 1930s the sport grew in popularity, especially in Britain where teams from the Birmingham Small Arms Company (BSA), Norton, Matchless, Rudge, and AJS competed in the events.<br/>More recently, they have been used in races held on either supercross or motocross tracks.<br/>Freestyle motocross (FMX) events where riders are judged on their jumping and aerial acrobatic skills have gained popularity, as has supermoto, where motocross machines race both on tarmac and off-road.<br/>Motocross sidecars are purpose built frames

circus-based predecessors, these actors/stuntmen were not specifically trained to perform stunts, but instead learned through trial and error.<br/>There is maximum risk when the stunts are performed

similar devices called sea anchors to maintain stability in rough seas.<br/>Pulse jets are still occasionally used in amateur experiments.<br/>Because they can produce thrust on both land and water, they are commonly used on all-terrain vehicles.<br/>With the advent of modern technology, the pulse detonation engine has become practical and was successfully tested on a Rutan VariEze.<br/>The B-52

the vanguard of this development, both producing very radical designs well ahead of their time.<br/>It is not uncommon for riders to transport multiple passengers or large goods aboard small motorcycles and scooters simply because there is no better alternative.<br/>A Norwegian study has looked at the reasons behind motorcycle death accidents.<br/>Recent years have seen an increase in the

answering a question truthfully, or performing a \"double dare\", both of which are played by both players.<br/>Dare (band), a band fronted by Darren Wharton.<br/>The questioner then selects a random slip from that pile and reads it out - either asking the answerer a question or requiring that they perform a daring forfeit.<br/>Players must perform the dare they are given, or truthfully answer the

motorcyclists.<br/>Knievel briefly used a Honda 250cc motorcycle to jump a crate of rattlesnakes and two mountain lions, his first known jump.<br/>To keep his name in the news, Knievel proposed his biggest stunt ever, a motorcycle jump across the Grand Canyon.<br/>Knievel would preach an anti-drug message to children and adults before each of his stunts.<br/>Over the course of his career, he attempted more than 75 ramp-to-ramp motorcycle jumps.<br/>The jump took place 33 years after his father, Evel Knievel, made daredevil history by jumping over 14 Greyhound buses at Kings

system that keeps the helmet (and head) attached to the body in severe collisions.<br/>In the early days of the automobile, some motorists also adopted this style of headgear, and early football

to and from school or school-related activities, but not including a charter bus or transit bus.<br/>Within the educational system, the design is primarily used for extracurricular activities requiring bus transportation.<br/>Larger buses may often be derived from school buses (newly purchased or second-hand).<br/>To better protect passengers, MFSABs share the body structure and compartmentalized seating layout of school buses.<br/>The size of a school bus generally limits visibility for both the children and motorists during loading and unloading.<br/>this is commonly achieved with red LEDs.<br/>by 1900, 16 other states would transport students to school.<br/>When loading and unloading students, school buses have the ability to stop traffic, using a system of warning lights and stop arms-a stop sign that is deployed from the bus to stop traffic.<br/>As the use of school buses transports students on a much larger scale than by car (on average, the same as 36 separate automobiles), their use reduces pollution in the same manner as carpooling.<br/>Other farms use unconverted, re-painted, school buses to transport their workforce.<br/><br/><strong>bus</strong><strong>: </strong>In some sparsely populated areas, it is common to use brucks, buses with a cargo area to transport both passengers and cargo at the same time.<br/>This shuttle usage can be as transport between locations, or to and from parking lots.<br/>Buses are often hired for parades or processions.<br/>High specification luxury coaches are often chartered by companies for executive or VIP transport.<br/>Companies such as railroads, construction contractors, and agricultural firms may own buses to transport employees to and from remote job sites.<br/>Tour buses often carry a tour guide, although the driver or a recorded audio commentary may also perform this function.<br/>In some countries, particularly the US and Canada, buses used to

seasoning of lumber is typically either kiln- or air-dried.<br/>The length of a board is usually specified separately from the width and depth.<br/>Specifically, it is lumber cut for industrial or wood-packaging use.<br/>Dimensional lumber made from softwood is typically used for construction, while hardwood boards are more commonly used for making cabinets or furniture.<br/>these usually retail in big-box stores and using only a relatively small set of specified lengths.<br/>When large holes are needed, they can typically be made in the webbing only and only in the center third of the span.<br/>Lumber is cut by ripsaw or resaw to create dimensions that are not usually processed by a primary sawmill.<br/>Preserved wood is used most often for railroad ties, utility poles, marine piles, decks, fences and other outdoor applications.<br/>In the United States, pilings are mainly cut from southern yellow pines and Douglas firs.<br/>Defects due to fungi and animals.<br/><br/><strong>grains</strong><strong>: </strong>In North America, farmers commonly deliver their newly harvested grain to a grain elevator, a large storage facility that consolidates the crops of many farmers.<br/>However, some are only grown in cooler highlands, where it ' \"may\" ' be possible to grow multiple crops per year.<br/>Cool-season cereals are well-adapted to temperate climates.<br/>Rice is commonly grown in flooded fields, though some strains are grown on dry land.<br/>Storage facilities should be protected from small grain pests, rodents and birds.<br/>For the past few decades, there has also been increasing interest in perennial grain plants.<br/>In some developing countries, grain in the form of rice, wheat, millet, or maize constitutes a majority of daily sustenance.<br/>Thus, major global commodity markets exist for maize, rice, soybeans, wheat and other grains but not for tubers, vegetables, or other crops.<br/>In this case, the grain is sent to a dehydrating facility, where artificial heat dries it.<br/>The two main types of commercial grain crops are cereals and legumes.<br/><br/><strong>difficult</strong><strong>: </strong>Degree of

unprocessed cheeses, heating does not alter its taste or texture.<br/>Processed meat is usually composed of pork or beef, but also poultry, while it can also contain offal or meat by-products such as blood.<br/>It is typically made from a blend of cheeses, most often Colby and cheddar.<br/>Processed cheese is often sold in blocks, pressurized cans, and packs of individual slices, often separated by wax paper, or with each slice individually wrapped by machine.<br/>Such products tend to be classified as \"cheese food\", \"cheese spread\", or \"cheese product\" (depending primarily on the amount of cheese, moisture, and milkfat present in the final product).<br/>Processed cheese typically contains around 50-60% traditional cheese.<br/>In the United Kingdom, processed cheese is typically sold in individually wrapped slices, often referred to as \"singles\", or in foil-wrapped portions.<br/>Nitrate and nitrite are consumed from plant foods as well as animal foods, with 80% of

or claim to govern in the name of the people.<br/>A People's Republic is typically a Marxist or socialist one-party state that claims to govern on behalf of the people even if it in practice often turns out to be a dictatorship.<br/>Other states, such as Indiana, typically refer to themselves as the State in case captions and legal process.<br/>The political theory underlying this format is that criminal prosecutions are brought in the name of the sovereign.<br/>National identity.<br/>Outside the United States, criminal trials in Ireland and the Philippines are prosecuted in the name of

background in the American League.<br/>A baseball field can be referred to as a diamond.<br/>The parks were built to hold baseball as well as football, soccer, and other sports.<br/>It was viewed as obsolete only a year into its life.<br/>For example, the 4 retractable-roof parks built in the United States during the retro era are also considered to be retro-modern ballparks.<br/>As a result, it is not generally considered to be a retractable-roof facility.<br/>New \"retro\" parks, which try to recapture the feel of the jewel box parks, are often designed to have these quirks.<br/>The field itself is graced by a distinctive dirt strip between home plate and the pitching mound.<br/>Such tall fences are often used to stop easy home runs in a section of the ballpark where the distances from home are shorter, or where there is little space between the field and the street beyond.<br/><br/><strong>baseball</strong><strong>: </strong>By the late 19th century, baseball was widely recognized as the national sport of the United States.<br/>The first game in the NL\u2014on Saturday, April 22, 1876 (at the Jefferson Street Grounds, Philadelphia)\u2014is often pointed to as the beginning of MLB.<br/>Writing in 1919, philosopher Morris Raphael Cohen described baseball as America's national religion.<br/>In Asia, baseball is among the most popular sports in Japan and South Korea.<br/>Widely known as America's pastime, baseball is well established in several other countries as well.<br/>Although baseball is a team sport, individual players are often placed under scrutiny and pressure.<br/>The baseball cap has become a ubiquitous fashion item not only in the United States and Japan, but also in countries where the sport itself is not particularly popular, such as the United Kingdom.<br/>Consensus once held that today's baseball is a North American development from the older game rounders, popular among children in Great Britain and Ireland.<br/>Overall, baseball has a large following in the United States.<br/>By early in the 20th century, intercollegiate baseball was Japan's leading sport.<br/><br/><strong>world series</strong><strong>: </strong>The series was promoted and referred to as \"The Championship of the United States\", \"World's Championship Series\", or \"World's Series\" for short.<br/>Most importantly, the now-official and compulsory World Series matches were operated strictly by the National Commission itself, not by the participating clubs.<br/>By the 1990s, baseball was played at a highly skilled level in many countries.<br/>Game 6 of the 1975 World Series is regarded by most as one of the greatest World Series games ever played.<br/>Japanese professional players also have a difficult time coming to the North American leagues.<br/>Afterward, World Series games were frequently scheduled at night, when television audiences were larger.<br/>The Series turned out to indeed have serious consequences for the sport.<br/>1992\u20131993: The World Series enters Canada.<br/>Players, coaches and others associated with the team are generally given World Series rings to commemorate their victory.<br/>As the series is played during the fall season in North America, it is also referred to as the Fall Classic.<br/><br/><strong>men</strong><strong>: </strong>Anthropology has shown that masculinity itself has social status, just like wealth, race and social class.<br/>In Western culture, for example, greater masculinity usually brings greater social status.<br/>To what extent masculinity is biologically or socially influenced is subject to debate.<br/>In all cultures in the past, and still among traditional and non-Western cultures, getting married is the most common and definitive distinction between boyhood and manhood.<br/>The Parsons model was used to contrast and illustrate extreme positions on gender roles.<br/>This difference in the relative amounts of these sex steroids is largely responsible for the physiological differences that distinguish men from women.<br/>In the late 20th century, some qualities traditionally associated with marriage (such as the \"triple Ps\" of protecting, providing, and procreating) were still considered signs of having achieved manhood.<br/>Prior to adulthood, a male human is referred to as a boy (a male child or adolescent).<br/>Like most other male mammals, a man's genome usually inherits an X chromosome from the mother and a Y chromosome from the father.<br/>Although masculinity is socially constructed, some research indicates that some behaviors considered masculine are biologically influenced.<br/><br/><strong>pie</strong><strong>: </strong>therefore it is often said that PIE had a pitch accent.<br/>In the United States of America, there is a popular saying that \"there are few things as American as apple pie\".<br/>The Venetic and  Liburnian languages known from the North Adriatic region are sometimes classified as Italic.<br/>Ancient Greeks are believed to have originated pie pastry.<br/>Frozen pot pies are often sold in individual serving size.<br/>This kind of derivation is likely related to the possessive adjectives, and can be seen as essentially the reverse of it.<br/>This combination, and possibly the name as well, is thought to have been popularized in the mid-1890s in the United States.<br/>In the northern states, pumpkin pie was popular, as pumpkins were plentiful.<br/>The Cornish pasty is an adaptation of the pie to a working man's daily food needs.<br/>In the Midwest, cheese and cream pies were popular, due to the availability of big dairy farms.<br/><br/><strong>apple pie</strong><strong>: </strong>Although eaten in Europe since long before the European colonization of the Americas, apple pie as used in the phrase \"as American as apple pie\" describes something as being \"typically American\".<br/>In the United States of America, there is a popular saying that \"there are few things as American as apple pie\".<br/>Apple pie with cheddar is popular in the American Midwest and New England, particularly in Vermont, where it is considered the state dish.<br/>Ancient Greeks are believed to have originated pie pastry.<br/>Frozen pot pies are often sold in individual serving size.<br/>Apple pie is an unofficial symbol of the United States and one of its signature comfort foods.<br/>Apple pie is often served \u00e0 la mode, that is, topped with ice cream.<br/>In English-speaking countries, apple pie, often classified as a satisfying 'comfort' food, is a dessert of enduring popularity, whether it's eaten hot or cold, on its own or with ice cream, double cream, or custard.<br/>This combination, and possibly the name as well, is thought to have been popularized in the mid-1890s in the United States.<br/>In the north of England, Wensleydale cheese is often used.<br/><br/><strong>batter</strong><strong>: </strong>The practice of beer battering is popular in Australia, New Zealand, the United States, Britain, Ireland, Germany, Iceland and Russia.<br/>Batter is most often used for pancakes, light cakes, and as a coating for fried foods.<br/>Some foods that are commonly beer battered and fried are fish, chips, and onion rings.<br/>All batters work by forming a crisp shell around the food, preventing scorching and retaining flavor and juices.<br/>Batters are used in many cuisines under many names.<br/>Beer is a popular ingredient in batters used to coat foods before frying.<br/>The ideal batter for fried foods is to be thick enough to adhere to the food, but not so thick as to become heavy.<br/>The purpose of using beer is so the bubbles in the beer will add body and lightness to the batter.<br/>Many batters are made by combining dry flours with liquids such as water, milk or eggs.<br/>Batter (baseball), person whose turn it is to face the pitcher.<br/><br/><strong>this sport</strong><strong>: </strong>These trends are seen by many as contrary to the fundamental ethos of sport being carried on for its own sake and for the enjoyment of its participants.<br/>Super Bowl Sunday is a de facto national holiday in America.<br/>The practice of athletic competitions has been criticised by some Christian thinkers as a form of idolatry, in which \"human beings extol themselves, adore themselves, sacrifice themselves and reward themselves.<br/>In the history of Ireland, Gaelic sports were connected with cultural nationalism.<br/>The sport was developed in Spain during the late 1990s and is currently played mainly in Europe.<br/>Sport betting is in some cases severely regulated, and in some cases is central to the sport.<br/>\" Sports are seen by these critics as a manifestation of \"collective pride\" and \"national self-deification\" in which feats of human power are idolized at the expense of divine worship.<br/>Youth sport in the US is a $15 billion industry including equipment up to private

deli meat sandwiches, and sweet sandwiches, such as a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.<br/>For example, the phrase jeely piece refers to a jam sandwich.<br/>For example, an ice cream sandwich consists of a layer of ice cream between two layers of cake or biscuit.<br/>However, hot sliced (not ground) beef between two slices of toasted bread is referred to as a steak sandwich:  it is the sliced loaf bread that distinguishes the steak sandwich from a burger.<br/>The sandwich began as a portable finger food in the Western world, though over time it has become prevalent worldwide.<br/>The sandwich's popularity in Spain and England increased dramatically during the nineteenth century, when the rise of industrial society and the working classes made fast, portable, and inexpensive meals essential.<br/>The modern concept of a sandwich using slices of bread as found within the West can arguably be traced to 18th-century Europe.<br/>In the UK and Australia, the term sandwich is more narrowly defined than in the US: it refers usually to an item which uses sliced bread from a loaf.<br/>during that decade sandwich bars also became an important form of eating establishment in western Holland, typically serving liver and salt beef sandwiches.<br/>Similar usage applies in other Spanish-speaking cultures, such as Mexico, where the word torta is also used for a popular variety of roll-type sandwiches.<br/><br/><strong>miss</strong><strong>: </strong>It was organised by the local press.<br/>The number of participants in the preliminary rounds of the pageant has increased considerably.<br/>In 2004, Lakshmi Pandit (sister of Kalpana Pandit) was initially declared as the winner but had to return the title as she was married (to Siddarth Mishra).<br/>India did not compete in the Miss Universe pageant from 1953 to 1963.<br/>She quit the industry very early and got married.<br/>Femina Miss India dropped the franchise of Miss International in 2015.<br/>she was stripped of her title and Dolly Mihas was declared winner.<br/>^Note 1  : Punjab is the only state which had placed in all four of the regional editions of the pageant till day.<br/>It is organised by Femina, a women's magazine published by The Times Group.<br/>It is a shortened form of mistress, and departed from misses/missus which became used to signify marital attachment in the 18th and 19th centuries.<br/><br/><strong>bacon</strong><strong>: </strong>It is lower in fat and food energy than bacon, but may be used in a similar manner (such as in a BLT sandwich).<br/>Different cuts of pork are used for making bacon depending on local preferences.<br/>Bacon bits are made from small, crumbled pieces of bacon.<br/>Hot bacon sandwiches are a popular cafe dish in the UK and Ireland, and are anecdotally recommended as a hangover cure.<br/>The inclusion of skin with a cut of bacon, known as the 'bacon rind', varies, though is less common in the English-speaking world.<br/>Vegetarian bacon is usually made from marinated strips of textured soy protein or tempeh.<br/>Sodium polyphosphates, such as sodium triphosphate, may also be added to make the product easier to slice and to reduce spattering when the bacon is pan-fried.<br/>Tatws Pum Munud is a traditional Welsh stew, made with sliced potatoes, vegetables and smoked bacon.<br/>Fried or grilled bacon rashers are included in the \"traditional\" full breakfast.<br/>it is largely similar in appearance to pork bacon except for the darker colour.<br/><br/><strong>glass cup</strong><strong>: </strong>Recipes have been published for cooking various dishes in cups in the microwave.<br/>Collins glass, for a tall mixed drink.<br/>The modern shot glass has a thicker base and sides than the older whiskey glass.<br/>A chalice is often used for this purpose.<br/>They are often used by fast-food restaurants and coffee shops to serve beverages.<br/>There are over a dozen distinct styles of cups for drinking beer, depending on the precise variety of beer.<br/>Contemporary American \"rocks\" glasses may be much larger, and used for a variety of beverages over ice.<br/>Pint glass, for an Imperial pint of beer or cider.<br/>Cups are an improvement on using cupped hands or feet to hold liquids.<br/>There are companies that provide the service of printing slogans on cups.<br/><br/><strong>cucumber</strong><strong>: </strong>There is no vinegar used in the brine of naturally fermented pickled cucumbers.<br/>Vinegar and sugar are often added after the 24-hour soak in lime, along with pickling spices.<br/>This is a popular dish in the southern US, and a rising trend elsewhere in the US.<br/>Cucumbers are placed in a glass vessel along with spices (usually dill and garlic), water and salt.<br/>A \"kosher\" dill pickle is not necessarily kosher in the sense that it has been prepared in accordance with Jewish dietary law.<br/>Rather, it is a pickle made in the traditional manner of Jewish New York City pickle makers, with generous addition of garlic and dill to a natural salt brine.<br/>The fermentation process is dependent on the Lactobacillus bacteria that naturally occur on the skin of a growing cucumber.<br/>This is also done in Japan, where it is referred to as \"stick pickle\" (\u4e00\u672c\u6f2c, ippon-tsuke).<br/>Pickled cucumbers are often part of mixed pickles.<br/>The more salt added, the more sour the cucumbers become.<br/><br/><strong>a pb</strong><strong>: </strong>The peanut butter in PB Max was sweetened with sugar and combined with hydrogenated vegetable oil to prevent separation.<br/>According to former Mars executive Alfred Poe, PB Max was discontinued due to the Mars family's distaste for peanut butter, despite $50

power is provided by steam turbines.<br/>Another means of supplying lower-pressure boiler feed water is an injector, which uses a steam jet usually supplied from the boiler.<br/>Some motors are powered by potential or kinetic energy, for example some funiculars, gravity plane and ropeway conveyors have used the energy from moving water or rocks, and some clocks have a weight that falls under gravity.<br/>Other forms of potential energy include compressed gases (such as pneumatic motors), springs (clockwork motors) and elastic bands.<br/>They may be powered by direct current (for example a battery powered portable device or motor vehicle), or by alternating current from a central electrical distribution grid.<br/>Historic military siege engines included large catapults, trebuchets, and (to some extent) battering rams were powered by potential energy.<br/>A hydraulic motor derives its power from a pressurized liquid.<br/>The most useful instrument for analyzing the performance of steam engines is the steam engine indicator.<br/>Non-thermal motors usually are powered by a chemical reaction, but are not heat engines.<br/><br/><strong>power</strong><strong>: </strong>Engine

hands of untrained individuals: \".<br/>But knowledge of the forms cannot be gained through sensory experience because the forms are not in the physical world.<br/>The function of humans in our world is therefore to imitate the ideal world as much as possible which, importantly, includes imitating the good, i.<br/>The criteria for selection by the academics is ability to perceive forms (the analog of English \"intelligence\") and martial spirit as well as predisposition or aptitude.<br/>, the form is shared out somehow like the day to many places.<br/>The idea of the perfect circle is

microscopic view of a gas is described by the kinetic-molecular theory.<br/>These intermolecular forces result from electrostatic interactions between gas particles.<br/>These events are also described by particle theory.<br/>The symbol used to represent volume in equations is \"V\" with SI units of cubic meters.<br/>All of these excepted conditions allow energy transfer to take place within the gas system.<br/>The symbol used to represent pressure in equations is \"p\" or \"P\" with SI units of pascals.<br/>The symbol used to represent specific volume in equations is \"v\" with SI units of cubic meters per kilogram.<br/>The symbol used to represent density in equations is \u03c1 (rho) with SI units of kilograms per cubic meter.<br/>An example where the \"ideal gas

such as horses (domesticated in the 4th or the 3rd millennium BCE), oxen (from about 8000 BCE).<br/>Also, a train can be powered by horses, cables, gravity, pneumatics and gas turbines.<br/>The most common road vehicle is the automobile.<br/>The aircraft is the second fastest method of transport, after the rocket.<br/>Cable transport is a broad mode where vehicles are pulled by cables instead of an internal power source.<br/>this is most commonly done through a steam engine, combustion engine, electric motor, a jet engine or a rocket, though other means of propulsion also exist.<br/>Early water transport was accomplished with ships that were either rowed or used the wind for propulsion, or a combination of the two.<br/>It is possible to provide door-to-door service only by road transport.<br/>Some ships, such as submarines, use nuclear power to produce the steam.<br/>The locomotive can be powered by steam, diesel or by electricity supplied by trackside

was a relatively volatile hydrocarbon obtained from coal gas.<br/>The solution to the expansion of storage, transportation, finances, and production was the creation of the Defense Supplies Corporation on 19 September 1940.<br/>The first internal combustion engines suitable for use in transportation applications, so-called Otto engines, were developed in Germany during the last quarter of the 19th century.<br/>Also, the use of natural gasoline increased greatly.<br/>The specific gravity of gasoline is from 0.<br/>the relevant metric for diesel engines is the cetane number.<br/>Virtually all of Germany's aviation gasoline came from synthetic oil plants that hydrogenated coals and coal tars.<br/>Most gasoline sold in Sweden has 5\u201315% ethanol added.<br/>The price of gasoline in Europe is typically higher than that in the U.<br/><br/><strong>electricity</strong><strong>: </strong>Other forms of electricity generation used in niche applications include the triboelectric effect, the piezoelectric effect, the thermoelectric effect, and betavoltaics.<br/>Most electric generation is driven by heat engines.<br/>His method, still used today, is for electricity to be generated by the movement of a loop of wire, or Faraday disc, between the poles of a magnet.<br/>Almost all commercial electrical generation is done using electromagnetic induction, in which mechanical energy forces a generator to rotate:.<br/>Currently, most electrochemical power comes from batteries.<br/>The SI unit of power is the watt, one joule per second.<br/>A small proportion of electric power distributed by utilities is provided by batteries.<br/>Almost all commercial electrical power on Earth is generated with a turbine, driven by wind, water, steam or burning gas.<br/>This is the most used form for generating electricity and is based on Faraday's law.<br/>Other energy sources include solar photovoltaics and geothermal power.<br/><br/><strong>diesel</strong><strong>: </strong>Many different methods of injection can be used.<br/>On bigger ships, high-speed diesel engines are often used for powering electric generators.<br/>The highest power output of high-speed diesel engines is approximately 5 MW.<br/>Four-stroke engines on ships are usually used to power an electric generator.<br/>An additional advantage of the diesel engine is the lack of fuel during the compression stroke.<br/>The popularity of diesel-powered passenger cars in markets such as India, South Korea and Japan is increasing (as of 2018).<br/>A supercharger is powered mechanically by the engine's crankshaft, while a turbocharger is powered by the engine exhaust.<br/>Submarines are usually diesel-electric.<br/>A necessary component of all diesel engines is a mechanical or electronic governor which regulates the torque of the engine and thus idling speed and maximum speed by controlling the rate of fuel delivery.<br/>Stationary diesel engines are commonly used for electricity generation, but also for powering refrigerator compressors, or other types of compressors or pumps.<br/><br/>", "concept":

areas of the world are already experiencing stress on water availability (or water scarcity).<br/>Although most aquatic organisms have a limited ability to regulate their osmotic balance and therefore can only live within a narrow range of salinity, diadromous fish have the ability to migrate between fresh water and saline water bodies.<br/>In some cases this acid rain results in pollution of lakes and rivers.<br/>Fresh water falling as mist, rain or snow contains materials dissolved from the atmosphere and material from the sea and land over which the rain bearing clouds have traveled.<br/>Currently, as energy is limited the coefficient of resource input to output, thus process efficiency is the determinant.<br/>In Australia, over-abstraction of fresh water for intensive irrigation activities has caused 33% of the land area to be at risk of salination.<br/>Inappropriate use of water may contribute to this problem.<br/>Fresh water can easily become polluted by human activities or due to naturally occurring processes, such as erosion.<br/><br/><strong>long exposure</strong><strong>: </strong>Boats in long exposures disappear during the daytime, but draw bright

his encounter with a puddle in Gloucester.<br/>A similar legend, of a young boy drowning in a puddle that formed in a pothole in a major street in the early years of Seattle, Washington, is told as part of the Seattle Underground Tour.<br/><br/><strong>leaf</strong><strong>: </strong>Some sawflies similarly roll the leaves of their food plants into tubes.<br/>Other herbivores and their predators mimic the appearance of the leaf.<br/>Females of the Attelabidae, so-called leaf-rolling weevils, lay their eggs into leaves that they then roll up as means of protection.<br/>Some species have cryptic adaptations by which they use leaves in avoiding predators.<br/>For example, the caterpillars of some leaf-roller moths will create a small home in the leaf by folding it over

milliwatts of sunlight to the retina, slightly heating it and potentially causing damage in eyes that cannot respond properly to the brightness.<br/>The brightness of the Sun can cause pain from looking at it with the naked eye.<br/>The sunlight that is destined for the eyepiece is reflected from an unsilvered surface of a piece of glass.<br/>It was the center of a popular cult among Romans, who would stand at dawn to catch the first rays of sunshine as they prayed.<br/>Only a very small fraction of the incident light is reflected.<br/>It is estimated that the Sun has become 30% brighter in the last 4.<br/>If the glass breaks because of the heat, no light at all is reflected, making the device fail-safe.<br/>It is claimed that even brief glances at the midday Sun through an unfiltered telescope can cause permanent damage.<br/><br/><strong>sunlight</strong><strong>: </strong>Many people find direct sunlight to be too bright for comfort, especially when reading from white paper upon which the sunlight is directly shining.<br/>Cars, many helmets and caps are equipped with visors to block the Sun from direct vision when the Sun is at a low angle.<br/>Sunshine is often blocked from entering buildings through the use of walls, window blinds, awnings, shutters, curtains, or nearby shade trees.<br/>Even on Pluto, the sunlight would still be bright enough to almost match the average living room.<br/>To compensate for the brightness of sunlight, many people wear sunglasses.<br/>When the direct radiation is not blocked by clouds, it is experienced as sunshine.<br/>The effect of sunlight is relevant to painting, evidenced for instance in works of Eduard Manet and Claude Monet on outdoor scenes and landscapes.<br/>Indeed, looking directly at the Sun can cause long-term vision damage.<br/>The illumination of a horizontal surface will be considerably less than this if the Sun is not very high in the sky.<br/>The actual brightness of sunlight that would be observed at the surface also depends on the presence and composition of an atmosphere.<br/><br/><strong>the room</strong><strong>: </strong>The toilet, often a simple pit latrine, was put in an outhouse or privy, to

detection of changes in light intensity, enabling the fly to react swiftly to the approach of an object.<br/>They are protected from the ants by imitating chemical odours given by ant colony members.<br/>However, consumers are opposed to the inclusion of insects in their food, and the use of insects in animal feed remains illegal in areas such as the European Union.<br/>This leads to flies having more reproduction abilities than most insects, and much quicker.<br/>In some females, the sclerites are rolled into a flexible, telescopic ovipositor.<br/>This forces the male to lie on his back for his genitalia to remain engaged with those of the female, or the torsion of the male genitals allows the male to mate while remaining upright.<br/>It has been suggested that fly larvae could be used at a large scale as food for farmed chickens, pigs, and fish.<br/>Some plants are pollinated by fungus feeding flies that visit fungus infected male flowers.<br/>Flies that feed on blood

effects such as glare and heat gain.<br/>Window sills slant outward to drain water away from the inside of the building.<br/>This type of window allows for natural daylight and moonlight.<br/>Passive solar windows allow light and solar energy into a building while minimizing air leakage and heat loss.<br/>Some window coverings control solar heat gain and glare.<br/>Picture windows provide an unimpeded view, as if framing a picture.<br/>Such a design allows considerable solar light and heat penetration due to the most commonly occurring incidence of sun angles.<br/>A fixed window is a window that cannot be opened, whose function is limited to allowing light to enter (unlike an unfixed window, which can open and close).<br/>In passive solar building design, an extended eave is typically used to control the amount of solar light and heat entering the window(s).<br/>Photovoltaic windows not only provide a clear view and illuminate rooms, but also convert sunlight to

is caused by the filling of the valence shell of the atom.<br/>He was the first person to notice the periodicity of the elements.<br/>The group 1 members are easily cut with a knife.<br/>This also explains why the 3d contraction has a stronger effect on the following elements than the 4d or 5d ones do.<br/>they behave as if they were located on the left side of the table.<br/>They therefore screen the nuclear charge incompletely, and therefore the valence electrons that fill immediately after the completion of such a core subshell are more tightly bound by the nucleus than would be expected.<br/>Hence the non-relativistic Bohr model is inaccurate when applied to such an element.<br/>It is capable of forming alloy-like hydrides, featuring metallic bonding, with some transition metals.<br/>The 3d elements show the opposite effect.<br/><br/><strong>lamp</strong><strong>: </strong>The deep purple glass filters out most of the visible colors of light directly emitted by the mercury-vapor discharge, producing proportionally less visible light compared with UV light.<br/>The fill gas helps determine the electrical characteristics of the lamp, but does not give off light itself.<br/>otherwise, the mercury accumulates at one end of the tube.<br/>Museum artifacts may need protection from UV light to prevent degradation of pigments or textiles.<br/>Lamp fixture design must control light from a long tube instead of a compact globe.<br/>If the lamp does not ignite, an electronic circuit stops the operation of the ballast.<br/>Not all the UV radiation striking the phosphor coating is converted to visible light.<br/>The sputtered material collects on the walls of the tube, darkening it.<br/>This technique has become popular among aquatic gardeners as a cost-effective way to add more light to their aquariums.<br/>Hum is eliminated in lamps with a high-frequency electronic ballast.<br/><br/><strong>curtain</strong><strong>: </strong>Window treatment helps control the ambiance and flow of natural light into the room.<br/>Curtains are often hung on the inside of a building's windows to block the passage of light.<br/>They not only block out the light, but can also serve as an acoustic or thermal dampener.<br/>during the day most sheer fabrics will allow people inside the home to see the outside view while preventing people outside the home from seeing directly into the home.<br/>For instance, at night to aid sleeping, or to stop light from escaping outside the building (stopping people outside from being able to see inside, often for privacy reasons).<br/>They are held out of the way of the window by means of curtain tie-backs.<br/>As a result, when curtains made from uncoated fabrics are closed in an attempt to block out direct sunlight, light will still be visible through the curtain.<br/>However, the fabric itself is typically not thick enough to completely absorb strong light sources.<br/>Curtain liners are used to protect actual curtains from getting wet.<br/>Various architectural structures around the curtain can minimize these air drafts, but usually they are just used for decoration and make rooms feel more cozy.<br/><br/><strong>curtains</strong><strong>: </strong>Window treatment helps control the ambiance and flow of natural light into the room.<br/>Curtains are often hung on the inside of a

producing a steady temperature inside the building throughout summer and winter.<br/>first storey was on the surface of the ground, where were cellars and granaries, and great boxes, tuns, casks, and other domestic utensils.<br/>The entrance to the fortress is by means of a bridge, which, rising from the outer side of the moat and supported on posts as it ascends, reches to the top of the mound.<br/>Similarly, the corners of a square keep created dead space that defenders could not fire at, but missile fire in castle sieges was less important until the introduction of the crossbow in the middle of the 12th century, when arrowslits began to be introduced.<br/>were designed to allow very rich men to live in luxury and splendour.<br/>In some cases the entrance stairs were protected by additional walls and a door, producing a forebuilding.<br/>In the 15th century, the protective function of keeps was compromised by improved artillery.<br/><br/><strong>glass</strong><strong>: </strong>Several processes such as toughening can increase the strength of glass.<br/>Glass is also employed as the aperture cover in many solar energy collectors.<br/>They are, therefore, less subject to stress caused by thermal expansion and thus less vulnerable to cracking from thermal shock.<br/>Optical glass typically has a refractive index of 1.<br/>This assumption is incorrect, as once solidified, glass stops flowing.<br/>Many emerging pharmaceuticals are practically insoluble in their crystalline forms.<br/>Usually, the melts are carried out in platinum crucibles to reduce contamination from the crucible material.<br/>Container glass has a lower magnesium oxide and sodium oxide content than flat glass, and a higher Silica, Calcium oxide, and Aluminum oxide content.<br/>As in other amorphous solids, the atomic structure of a glass lacks the long-range periodicity observed in crystalline solids.<br/>Glass is a ubiquitous material in optics by virtue of its ability to refract, reflect, and transmit light.<br/><br/>", "concept": "<strong>curtains</strong><strong>: </strong>curtains are capable of block light<br/>curtains are at the

found that educational television has many advantages.<br/><br/><strong>screen</strong><strong>: </strong>A method of stencilling that has increased in popularity over the past years is the photo emulsion technique:.<br/>Currently, synthetic threads are commonly used in the screen printing process.<br/>The type of tape used in for this purpose often depends upon the ink that is to be printed onto the substrate.<br/>The most popular mesh in general use is made of polyester.<br/>that is, the open spaces are where the ink will appear on the substrate.<br/>Plastisol is the most common ink used in commercial garment decoration.<br/>Next, the screen and frame are lined with a tape to prevent ink from reaching the edge of the screen and the frame.<br/>However, unlike traditional plate-making, these screens are normally exposed by using film positives.<br/>The frame which holds the mesh could be made of diverse materials, such as wood or aluminum, depending on the sophistication of the machine or the artisan procedure.<br/>the wet ink deposit is proportional to the thickness of the mesh and or stencil.<br/><br/><strong>sitting boy</strong><strong>:

father.<br/>In the Old Testament, the names of individuals are meaningful, and a change of name indicates a change of status.<br/>In certain African cultures, such as in Cameroon, the eldest son gets the family name for his given name.<br/>In many cultures it is common for the son to be named after the father or a grandfather.<br/>Dolphins and green-rumped parrotlets also use symbolic names to address contact calls to specific individuals.<br/>The name Mohammed and Ahmed are same, for example Suhel Ahmad or Mohammad Suhel are same.<br/>The name of a specific entity is sometimes called a proper name (although that term has a philosophical meaning also) and is, when consisting of only one word, a proper noun.<br/>They can identify a class or category of things, or a single thing, either uniquely, or within a given context.<br/>For some Indians, their birth name is different from their official name.<br/><br/><strong>phone</strong><strong>: </strong>It is estimated that 86% of

handset which is held up to the ear and mouth during conversation.<br/>Mobile phones are commonly used to collect location data.<br/>Police data in San Francisco show that half of all robberies in 2012 were thefts of cellular phones.<br/>According to the Federal Communications Commission, one out of three robberies involve the theft of a cellular phone.<br/>Sometimes the instruments were operated in pairs at each end, making conversation more convenient but also more expensive.<br/>This is more apparent in countries which ban both handheld and hands-free usage, rather than those which

art works visible in this scene include Michelangelo's David, Picasso's Guernica, and Banksy's British Cops Kissing.<br/>It's very obvious that when the photographer captured that photograph, he was referencing La Piet\u00e0, the Michelangelo sculpture of Mary holding the corpse of Jesus.<br/>Also the Archangel Gabriel (among other religious figures) is invoked in the bus scene.<br/>and when other characters discover Kee and her baby, they respond with \"Jesus Christ\" or the sign of the cross.<br/>This sound generally coincides with the death of a major character (Julian, Jasper) and is referred to by Julian herself, who describes the tones as the last time you'll ever hear that frequency.<br/>Instead, a special camera rig invented by Gary Thieltges of Doggicam Systems was employed, allowing Cuar\u00f3n to develop the scene as one extended shot.<br/>In the middle of one shot, blood splattered onto the lens, and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki convinced the director to leave it in.<br/>\"The creation of the single-shot sequences was a challenging, time-consuming process that sparked concerns from the studio.<br/>However, the commonly reported statement that the action scenes are continuous shots is not entirely true.<br/>In this way, then, the loss of the tones is symbolic of the loss of the characters.<br/><br/><strong>white chair</strong><strong>: </strong>In some cases, multiple materials are used to construct a chair.<br/>However, the person who is first chair in the first violin section is usually referred to as the concertmaster in the US or leader in the UK.<br/>The most common theories are that the chair was an outgrowth of indigenous Chinese furniture, that it evolved from a camp stool imported from Central Asia, that it was introduced to China by Christian missionaries in the seventh century, and that the chair came to China from India as a form of Buddhist monastic furniture.<br/>Hence in some chair designs, the armrest is not continuous to the chair back, but is missing in the elbow area.<br/>The two most relevant anthropometric measurement for chair design is the popliteal height and buttock popliteal length.<br/>for example a designing chair will be used for designers who sit at high easels.<br/>Mass-produced chairs are typically 15\u201317 inches (38\u201343 cm) deep.<br/>The legs are typically high enough for the seated person's thighs and knees to form a 90\u00b0 or lesser angle.<br/>A common thermoplastic used is thermoplastic polypropylene, with the granules being heated to about 220 degrees Celsius, and the melt injected into a mold.<br/>Mass-produced chairs are typically 17 inches (430 mm) high.<br/><br/><strong>laptop</strong><strong>: </strong>One study found that a laptop is three times more likely to break during the first year of use than a desktop.<br/>In some laptops, solar panels are able to generate enough solar power for the laptop to operate.<br/>Waste heat is usually exhausted away from the device operator towards the rear or sides of the device.<br/>Another common accessory is a laptop cooler, a device which helps lower the internal temperature of the laptop either actively or passively.<br/>A common practical solution to this problem is to place the laptop on a table or desk, or to use a book or pillow between the body and the laptop.<br/>This dust is usually stuck inside where the fan and heat sink meet, where it can not be removed by a casual cleaning and vacuuming.<br/>Wi-Fi networks and laptop programs are especially widespread at university campuses.<br/>Another solution is to obtain a cooling unit for the laptop.<br/>Schools, especially those with open plan designs, are often prime targets for thieves who steal high-value items.<br/>Today, laptops are commonly used in a variety of settings, such as at work, in education, for playing games, web browsing, for personal multimedia, and general home computer use.<br/><br/>", "concept":

that Bull Terrier heritage may have occurred.<br/>There is an anecdotal report of a Cattle Dog named Bluey, born in 1910 and living for 29.<br/>Others believe that this dog developed from crossing first the Black Bobtail Smithfield herding dog of England, which were brought to Australia in the early 19th century, with the dingo to produce the Red Bobtail, and then crossing with the Smooth-haired Blue Merle Collie.<br/>It is good with older, considerate children, but will herd people by nipping at their heels, particularly younger children who run and squeal.<br/>It is not a breed that lives in a pack with other dogs.<br/>This is not merle colouration (a speckled effect that has associated health issues), but rather the result of the ticking gene.<br/>Any of these are acceptable according to the breed standard.<br/>When on home ground, the Australian Cattle Dog is an affectionate and playful pet.<br/>It is ideally suited for navigating obstacle courses, since as a herding dog it is reactive to the handler's body language and willing to work accurately at a distance from the handler.<br/><br/><strong>bulldog</strong><strong>: </strong>Old English

American Bulldog is a breed that truly falls in love with his family and will do anything to keep it safe if the dog correctly senses danger up to, and including, risking its life to save

mountain range stemmed from indigenous American languages.<br/>The oldest petroglyphs in North America date from 15,000 to 10,000 years before present.<br/>On his map, the name is shown in large letters on what would now be considered South America, in honor of Amerigo Vespucci.<br/>The southern part of the North American continent is composed of two regions.<br/>The following table shows the most prominent sports leagues in North America, in order of average revenue.<br/>The short form \"United States\" is also standard.<br/>\"Columbia\", a name popular in American poetry and songs of the late 18th century, derives its origin from Christopher Columbus.<br/>The first documentary evidence of the phrase \"United States of America\" dates from a January 2, 1776 letter written by Stephen Moylan to George Washington's aide-de-camp Joseph Reed.<br/>The dominant languages in North America are English, Spanish, and French.<br/><br/><strong>france</strong><strong>: </strong>The name of the Franks is related to the English word frank (\"free\"): the latter stems from the Old French franc (\"free, noble, sincere\"), ultimately from Medieval Latin francus (\"free, exempt from service.<br/>The architecture associated to this era is named Second Empire in English, the term being taken from the Second French Empire.<br/>The etymology of *Frank is uncertain.<br/>Originally applied to the whole Frankish Empire, the name France comes from the Latin Francia, or \"realm of the Franks\".<br/>Three largest financial institutions cooperatively owned by their customers are located in France.<br/>It is traditionally derived from the Proto-Germanic word *frank\u014dn, which translates as \"javelin\" or \"lance\" (the throwing axe of the Franks was known as the francisca), although these weapons may have been named because of their use by the Franks, not the other way around.<br/>This label is intended to protect and promote remarkable gardens and parks.<br/>A common and traditional symbol of the French people is the Gallic rooster.<br/>The earliest French literature dates from the Middle Ages, when what is now known as modern France did not have a single, uniform language.<br/>The Renaissance painting School of Fontainebleau was directly inspired by Italian painters such as Primaticcio and Rosso Fiorentino, who both worked in France.<br/><br/><strong>school</strong><strong>: </strong>The word school derives from Greek \u03c3\u03c7\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae  (schol\u0113), originally meaning \"leisure\" and also \"that in which leisure is employed\", but later \"a group to whom lectures were given, school\".<br/>The term primary school is derived from the French \u00e9cole primaire, which was first used in an English text in 1802.<br/>The term school is rarely used for tertiary education, except for some upper or high schools (German: Hochschule), which describe colleges and universities.<br/>These schools are located in forests outside of the towns and villages, and the space used is solely for these schools.<br/>This terminology extends into research literature.<br/>The use of the term school varies by country, as do the names of the various levels of education within the country.<br/>The number of rooms required can be determined from the predicted roll of the school and the area needed.<br/>Text taken from #CommitToEducation, 35, UNESCO, UNESCO.<br/>The term grade school is sometimes used in the US, although this term may refer to both primary education and secondary education.<br/>Their training is focused on how to be a proper woman by societal standards.<br/><br/><strong>the word</strong><strong>: </strong>The most appropriate means of measuring the length of a word is by counting its syllables or morphemes.<br/>However, some languages have infixes, which are put inside a word.<br/>These extra words will tend to be added in the word boundaries of the original sentence.<br/>In these languages, words may be considered to be constructed from a number of morphemes.<br/>However, some written words are not minimal free forms as they make no sense by themselves (for example, the and of).<br/>Some words can be controversial, such as slang in formal contexts.<br/>Mandarin Chinese is a very analytic language (with few inflectional affixes), making it unnecessary to delimit words orthographically.<br/>The concept of \"word\" is usually distinguished from that of a morpheme, which is the smallest unit of word which has a meaning, even if it will not stand on its own.<br/>There are several ways to determine where the word boundaries of spoken language should be placed:.<br/>These can be taken as an indication of what constitutes a \"word\" in the opinion of the writers of that language.<br/><br/><strong>red sign</strong><strong>: </strong>The symbol was created by California Department of Transportation employee John Hood in the late 1980s.<br/>These changes were made for reasons of road safety.<br/>Similar pictograms are also used in Ireland, albeit on an amber diamond sign.<br/>This table shows the legal status of turns on red in various jurisdictions, where no sign is present or traffic signal explicitly prohibits it.<br/>Such signs are placed under traffic lights.<br/>In America and Ireland, signs connected with road work have an orange background.<br/>The warning signs usually contain a symbol.<br/>In Alberta, the sign for \"no left turn\" is defined with the line in the red circle flipped compared to other prohibitive signs.<br/>Right turns on red are permitted in many regions of North America.<br/>These signs are used to warn drivers of people walking in the street.<br/><br/>", "concept": "<strong>usa</strong><strong>: </strong>white river is

</strong>The positions to play in the outfield are left, center, and right field (named in relation to the batter's position.<br/>There are three infield positions that can only effectively be occupied by right-handed players: 2nd base, 3rd base, and shortstop.<br/>In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the first baseman is assigned the number 3.<br/>In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the third baseman is assigned the number 5.<br/>Unless otherwise noted, the specifications discussed in this section refer to those described within the Official Baseball Rules, under which Major League Baseball is played.<br/>Within the game there are positions in which each participating  player can play in.<br/>In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the second baseman is assigned the number 4, and the shortstop 6.<br/>Generally, base runners are not required to follow the baseline.<br/>In some youth leagues and adult recreational leagues, a \"double\" or \"safety\" first base may be used.<br/>However, a base runner's left-right motion is constrained when the defense tries to tag him.<br/><br/><strong>catcher</strong><strong>: </strong>The catcher is the most physically demanding position in baseball, more so than the pitcher.<br/>Catcher is a position for a baseball or softball player.<br/>The catcher must avoid hitting the batter-runner with the thrown ball, implying that they must move to a position in which they have a clear throw to the infielder at first base.<br/>History and evolution of the position.<br/>Since a catcher uses their fingers to signal and communicate with the pitcher, they may wear colorful stickers on their nails to accentuate the motion of the fingers and thus help with the visibility of the signal.<br/>The catcher is the only player on the field who is allowed to use this type of mitt.<br/>Consequently, players who are left-handed rarely play catcher.<br/>If at the time a pitch is about to be thrown in play, and the catcher has overextended the arm resulting in the catcher's glove being over the homeplate, a catcher's interference' is called and the batter walks to first base.<br/>Together, the rules changes and the new protective equipment transformed the catcher's defensive role to the way that it is presently played.<br/>Since this type of pitching often caused the batter to hit lazy, foul pop-ups, catchers played their position approximately twenty to twenty-five feet behind the batter, and wore no protective equipment.<br/><br/><strong>shortstop</strong><strong>: </strong>Adams's shortstop position, which he started playing at some time from 1849 to 1850, was used to field throws from the outfielders and throw to the three infielders.<br/>One theory of how the shortstop position got its name.<br/>Ernie Banks played shortstop for the first half of his career and first base for the remainder.<br/>The shortstop ordinarily is positioned near second base on the third-base side.<br/>In the numbering system used by scorers to record defensive plays, the shortstop is assigned the number 6.<br/>Shortstop, abbreviated SS, is the baseball or softball fielding position between second and third base, which is considered to be among the most demanding defensive positions.<br/>In practice, a marginal fielder as a shortstop who hits well can be moved to almost any other position, especially second base or third base, whether early in their careers (examples: George Brett and Mike Schmidt were both tried early in their careers as shortstops) or later due to diminished fielding range, slower reflexes, weaker throwing arms, increased risk of injury, or co-existence with another dominant shortstop, as with Ernie Banks, Cal Ripken Jr.<br/>Shortstops are required to cover second base in double play situations when the ball is hit to the second baseman or first baseman.<br/>They also cover second when a runner is attempting a stolen base, but only when a left-handed hitter is batting because the infield will respond to a left-handed batter by shifting toward first base, resulting in the shortstop being the infielder who is closest to second base.<br/>Historically the position was assigned to defensive specialists who were typically poor at batting and were often placed at the bottom of the batting order.<br/><br/><strong>sports</strong><strong>: </strong>Among other sports that originated in ancient Persia are polo and jousting.<br/>The competition element of sport, along

well.<br/>In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the second baseman is assigned the number 4.<br/>only four left-handed throwing players have ever played second base in Major League Baseball since 1950.<br/>In baseball and softball, second baseman, abbreviated 2B, is a fielding position in the infield, between second and first base.<br/>If a runner on first base attempts to steal second base, or if the pitcher attempts to pick off a runner already at second base, then either the second baseman or the shortstop will cover second base.<br/>In this case, if the runner is to be

rope at the area of the splice, which would cause problems in running the line through pulleys.<br/>A single rope is the most common, and is intended to be used by itself.<br/>Many types of knots have been developed to fasten with rope, join ropes, and utilize rope to generate mechanical advantage.<br/>The ancient Egyptians were probably the first civilization to develop special tools to make rope.<br/>An additional drawback of twisted construction is that every fibre is exposed to abrasion numerous times along the length of the rope.<br/>The long history of rope means that many systems have been used to state the size of a rope.<br/>The current preferred international standard for rope sizes is to give the mass per unit length, in kilograms per metre.<br/>Laid rope, also called twisted rope, is historically the prevalent form of rope, at least in modern Western history.<br/>This type of construction was pioneered by Yale Cordage.<br/>Common natural fibres for rope are manila

"wiki": "<strong>serve</strong><strong>: </strong>In children's tennis, young children may be encouraged to use the underhand serve on 36 feet (11 m) courts.<br/>The term kick serve is ambiguous.<br/>However, kick serve is commonly used to refer to any serve with heavy topspin or kick on it.<br/>In professional and amateur tennis, the reverse slice serve is rarely used except as a novelty.<br/>In the game of tennis, there are four commonly used serves: the \"flat serve\", the \"slice serve\", the \"kick serve\", and the \"underhand serve\".<br/>A serve (or, more formally, a service) in tennis is a shot to start a point.<br/>The underhand serve is struck below shoulder level.<br/>There are two popular stances in the tennis serve: the platform stance and the pinpoint stance.<br/>For a very long time, the use of an open stance to serve had been regarded as a sign of tennis beginner.<br/>The twist serve is a more extreme version of the kick serve, which involves more brushing of the ball from the 7\u20138 o'clock position to the 1\u20132 o'clock position, and faster swing speeds.<br/><br/><strong>forehand</strong><strong>: </strong>In tennis, except in the context of the phrase forehand volley, the term refers to a type of groundstroke\u2014a stroke in which the ball has bounced before it is struck.<br/>The forehand in tennis and other racket sports such as table tennis, squash and badminton is a shot made by swinging the racket across one's body with the hand moving palm-first.<br/>A well-known tactic is to run around a ball on their backhand side in order to hit a forehand cross-court, called the inside-out forehand.<br/>The extreme-western or Hawaiian grip is a very extreme tennis grip where the player places their knuckle past the 5th bevel on the tennis racket.<br/>There are four main grips for executing the forehand and their popularity has fluctuated over the years.<br/>For a right-handed player, the forehand is a stroke that begins on the right side of the body, continues across the body as contact is made with the ball, and ends on the left side of the body.<br/>The classical forehand where a player hit through the ball and finished their follow-through above the shoulder was the dominant forehand usage for most of tennis history.<br/>Most pro players now use the windshield wiper forehand, with Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic among other pro tennis players all employing the windshield wiper forehand.<br/>In his 1979 autobiography Jack Kramer, who had a great forehand himself, devotes a page to the best tennis strokes he had ever seen.<br/>Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro is an excellent example of an eastern forehand user.<br/><br/><strong>racket,racquet</strong><strong>: </strong>This is called either a paddle, racket, or a bat, with usage differing by region.<br/>Collectively, these games are known as racket sports.<br/>In the USA the term \"paddle\" is common, in Europe the term is \"bat\", and the official ITTF term is \"racket.<br/>This drawback is most common for professional players using single-handed topspin backhands, as well as for recreational and aged players at net.<br/>The only professional well-known player to have had success with a strongly choked-up grip is Zina Garrison.<br/>Rackets that are moderately higher in power production, moderately lower in weight, moderately larger in size, and which typically possess a slightly head-heavy balance are often called \"tweener rackets.<br/>This predecessor to the modern game of squash, rackets, is played with 30 1\u20442-inch (770 mm) wooden rackets.<br/>An extremely typical mistake beginning players make is to choke up heavily on the racket (to try to compensate for twist from a light racket, as well as too high racket angle upon impact) and use the wrist too much.<br/>In real tennis, also called court tennis, 27-inch (686-mm) long rackets are made of wood and very tight strings to cope with the game's heavy balls.<br/>The vastly higher injury rate in tennis (when compared with the wood era) is, in part, due to the increase in stiffness, both of the racket and of the strings.<br/><br/><strong>backhand</strong><strong>: </strong>Except in the phrase backhand volley, the term refers to a groundstroke (that is, one in which the ball has bounced before it is struck).<br/>The backhand is a tennis shot in which one swings the racquet around one's body with the back of the hand preceding the palm.<br/>Many tennis greats use the one-handed backhand.<br/>The advantages of the flat single-handed backhand include its speed, the angles it can produce and its depth.<br/>The advantages of the top-spin single-handed backhand include consistency, placement, the angles it can produce as well as its ability to cope with high balls.<br/>Despite there being many different variations and styles, in general there are three different techniques to hit the one-handed backhand.<br/>However, the two-handed backhand provides more stability and power for the shot, and is increasingly used in the modern game.<br/>The first notable players to use a two-handed backhand were the 1930s Australians Vivian McGrath and John Bromwich.<br/>From the 1940s to the 1960s, the flat single-handed backhand was popularised by many players, most famously Rod Laver and Don Budge.<br/>The first is the slice, the oldest version of the single-handed backhand, which was popularised by many classic players such as Ken Rosewall and was still used up until the 1980s even in the women's tour, with many great women champions such as Steffi Graf having one of the lowest, most effective slice backhands.<br/><br/><strong>sports</strong><strong>: </strong>The precise definition of what separates a sport from other leisure activities varies between sources.<br/>Key principles of sport include that the result should not be predetermined, and that both sides should have equal opportunity to win.<br/>Amateur participation in sport at lower levels is often called \"grassroots sport\".<br/>The practice of athletic competitions has been criticised by some Christian thinkers as a form of idolatry, in which \"human beings extol themselves, adore themselves, sacrifice themselves and reward themselves.<br/>Among other sports that originated in ancient Persia are polo and jousting.<br/>Hawk-Eye is also used in tennis to challenge umpiring decisions.<br/>Sportsmanship is an attitude that strives for fair play, courtesy toward teammates and opponents, ethical behaviour and integrity, and grace in victory or defeat.<br/>Other meanings include gambling and events staged for the purpose of gambling.<br/>There are many shades of judging between boxing and mixed martial arts, where victory is assigned by judges if neither competitor has lost at the end of the match time.<br/>Other organisations, such as the Council of Europe, preclude activities without a physical element from classification as sports.<br/><br/><strong>a low underhand tennis swing</strong><strong>: </strong>In children's tennis, young children may be encouraged to use the underhand serve on 36 feet (11 m) courts.<br/>The definition of a foot fault has changed several times since the introduction of (lawn) tennis.<br/>The term kick serve is ambiguous.<br/>However, kick serve is commonly used to refer to any serve with heavy topspin or kick on it.<br/>The term real is used as a retronym to distinguish the ancient game from the modern game of lawn tennis.<br/>Cannonball: Somewhat archaic term for a very fast, flat serve.<br/>In professional and amateur tennis, the reverse slice serve is rarely used except as a novelty.<br/>In the game of tennis, there are four commonly used serves: the \"flat serve\", the \"slice serve\", the \"kick serve\", and the \"underhand serve\".<br/>Dink: Onomatopoetic term for a shot with little pace, usually hit close to the net.<br/>Groundie: Colloquial word for a groundstroke.<br/><br/><strong>crouch</strong><strong>: </strong>The fact that Crouch possessed \"good touch for a big man\" became something of a media clich\u00e9 during this time.<br/>In the summer of 2006, Crouch adopted a robotic dancing goal celebration.<br/>His second book, How to be a Footballer, was released in 2018.<br/>He was also known for his longevity, and had a penchant for scoring acrobatic goals from bicycle kicks.<br/>Contemporary reports suggested that Crouch was the first player ever to reach ten goals for England within a single calendar year.<br/>however, he was also known for his lack of significant pace, strength, power, and athleticism, while his movement occasionally came under criticism in the media.<br/>In the latter appearance, Crouch's introduction as a second-half substitute was booed by England's own supporters.<br/>A tall forward, with a slender physique, Crouch was known for possessing a good first touch, despite his stature, as well as an eye for goal.<br/>A parody of a dance he had been seen performing on a television programme covering a party held at England teammate David Beckham's house, he first performed it after his goal for England against Hungary on 30 May.<br/>He again performed the dance after both of his first two goals against Jamaica on 3 June.<br/><br/><strong>soft tennis</strong><strong>: </strong>Most of the rules for soft tennis are the same as those for regular tennis.<br/>A special racquet and ball were developed, and the game became known as soft tennis (\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30c6\u30cb\u30b9, sofutotenisu).<br/>In 2004 soft tennis was introduced into Europe.<br/>Soft tennis is a racket game played on a court of two halves, separated by a net.<br/>The manager of the soft tennis club.<br/>This revision also enabled a forward player in doubles to serve.<br/>A member of the boys soft tennis club partnered up with Shingo.<br/>A member of the boys soft tennis club partnered up with Taiyo.<br/>A member of the boys soft tennis club partnered up with Tsubasa.<br/>At the end of the 19th century, tennis was introduced to Japan by a Western missionary, and it was later modified to better suit Japanese tastes.<br/><br/><strong>tennis</strong><strong>: </strong>A difficult shot in tennis is the return of an attempted lob over the backhand side of a player.<br/>There are various grips for executing the forehand, and their popularity has fluctuated over the years.<br/>For right-handed players, the backhand is a stroke that begins on the left side of their body, continues across their body as contact is made with the ball, and ends on the right side of their body.<br/>Experienced players strive to master the conventional overhand serve to maximize its power and placement.<br/>For a right-handed player, the forehand is a stroke that begins on the right side of the body, continues across the body as contact is made with the ball, and ends on the left side of the body.<br/>the term \"hard court\" was used for clay courts at the time.<br/>Another, however informal, tennis format is called Canadian doubles.<br/>It is commonly used in modern tennis especially by \u2018top professional players on the forehand\u2019.<br/>This is the most common stance in tennis.<br/>This is sometimes also referred to as the square stance.<br/><br/><strong>overhand</strong><strong>: </strong>There are a number of ways to tie the Overhand knot.<br/>In heraldry, the overhand knot is known as a \"Stafford knot\", owing to a representation of it being used first as a heraldic badge by the Earls of Stafford, and later as a general symbol of Staffordshire.<br/>The overhand knot is a stopper, especially when used alone, and hence it is very secure, to the point of jamming badly.<br/>If the two loose ends of an overhand knot are joined together (without creating additional crossings), this becomes equivalent to the trefoil knot of mathematical knot theory.<br/>An overhand knot becomes a trefoil knot, a true knot in the mathematical sense, by joining the ends.<br/>The overhand knot, also known as a a knot and half knot, is one of the most fundamental knots, and it forms the basis of many others, including the simple noose, overhand loop, angler's loop, reef knot, fisherman's knot, and water knot.<br/>If a flat ribbon or strip is tightly folded into a flattened overhand knot, it assumes a regular pentagonal shape.<br/>Trefoil knot, the mathematical treatment of the overhand knot.<br/>Overhand (boxing),

andrology.<br/>In neo-pagan Germanic mysticism, the alternative name of the Norse Algiz rune, where it is used as a purported life rune.<br/>The dictionary definition of man at

the first ice cream treatery to use a frozen granite slab to blend mix-in toppings into the ice cream.<br/>They were inspired by Steve Herrell of Herrell's Ice Cream in Boston, who pioneered the mixing approach to ice cream toppings.<br/>Later that year, Marble Slab was bought by Ronnie Hankamer of Texas, who laid the groundwork for the brand's franchising concept.<br/>December 2008: Bill Blass sold to Peacock International Holdings.<br/>The organization's mission is to \"Champion Brands and the People Who Build Them\".<br/>It specializes in franchising and quick-service restaurant

made the site but also produced the mysterious man's identikit using the mobile device application Ultimate Flash Face.<br/>Because it's hard for humans to remember people's faces in dreams, people

</strong>Even today, many Indians in rural areas use neem twigs for brushing every morning.<br/>Special appliances or tools may be used to supplement toothbrushing and interdental cleaning.<br/>When compared to toothbrushes, teeth-cleaning twigs have several advantages:.<br/>Although many trees are used in the production of teeth-cleaning twigs, some trees are better suited to clean and protect the teeth, due to the chemical composition of the plant parts.<br/>Those with dentures and natural teeth may supplement their cleaning with a denture cleaner.<br/>This end can be used to brush against the teeth, while the other end can be used as a toothpick.<br/>This involves the use of various instruments or devices to loosen and remove deposits from the teeth.<br/>Ensure that the back sides of the teeth (top and bottom rows) are being cleaned by brushing vertically in up and down motions.<br/>People routinely clean their own teeth by brushing and interdental cleaning, and dental hygienists can remove hardened deposits (tartar) not removed by routine cleaning.<br/>Lower cost (0\u201316% of the cost of a toothbrush).<br/><br/><strong>man</strong><strong>: </strong>Although in general men suffer from many of the same illnesses as women, they suffer from slightly more illnesses in comparison to women.<br/>However, there are exceptions to the above for some transgender and intersex men.<br/>In Western culture, for example, greater masculinity usually brings greater social status.<br/>The Parsons model was used to contrast and illustrate extreme positions on gender roles.<br/>Like most other male mammals, a man's genome usually inherits an X chromosome from the mother and a Y chromosome from the father.<br/>For example, men tend to be taller than women, but there are many people of both sexes who are in the mid-height range for the species.<br/>Anthropology has shown that masculinity itself has social status, just like wealth, race and social class.<br/>Like most other male mammals, a man's genome typically inherits an X chromosome from his mother and a Y chromosome from his father.<br/>This difference in the relative amounts of these sex steroids is largely responsible for the physiological differences that distinguish men from women.<br/>In all cultures in the past, and still among traditional and non-Western cultures, getting

dielectric constant of the tissue.<br/>At microwave frequencies, the transmission lines which are used to carry lower frequency radio waves to and from antennas, such as coaxial cable and parallel wire lines, have excessive power losses, so when low attenuation is required microwaves are carried by metal pipes called waveguides.<br/>Like a microwave, this lightbulb can burn, particularly if

door.<br/><br/><strong>ceramic</strong><strong>: </strong>most ceramic knife blades are made of this material.<br/>Barrier layer ceramic capacitors are made of doped ferroelectric materials such as barium titanate (BaTiO3).<br/>A lacquer or ceramic coating protects the capacitor against moisture and other ambient influences.<br/>A ceramic is any of the various hard, brittle, heat-resistant and corrosion-resistant materials made by shaping and then firing a nonmetallic mineral, such as clay, at a high temperature.<br/>A thin ceramic foil is cast from a suspension of the powder with a suitable binder.<br/>The easy-to-mold ceramic material facilitated the development of special and large styles of ceramic capacitors for high-voltage, high-frequency (RF) and power applications.<br/>Class 1 ceramic capacitors are accurate, temperature-compensating capacitors.<br/>The earliest ceramics made by humans were pottery objects (pots or vessels) or figurines made from clay, either by itself or mixed with other materials like silica, hardened and sintered in fire.<br/>For ferroelectric class 2 ceramic capacitors, the soldering temperature is above the Curie point.<br/>It is constructed of two or more alternating layers of ceramic and a metal layer acting as the electrodes.<br/><br/><strong>cup</strong><strong>: </strong>Prehistoric cups were sometimes fashioned from shells and hollowed out stones.<br/>therefore, while a cup made of paper is a \"paper cup\", a transparent one for drinking shots is called a \"shot glass\", instead.<br/>While in theory, most cups are well suited to hold drinkable liquids, hot drinks like tea are generally served in either insulated cups or porcelain teacups.<br/>The measuring cup, an adaptation of a simple cup, is a standard tool in cooking that has been in use at least as far back as Roman times.<br/>Many trophies take the form of a large, decorated cup.<br/>Disposable cups.<br/>Cups may be made of glass, metal, china, clay, wood, stone, polystyrene, plastic, aluminium or other materials, and are usually fixed with a stem, handles, or other adornments.<br/>Various cups have been designed so that drinking out of them without spilling is a challenge.<br/>A \"divining cup\" was supposed to be able to detect poison.<br/>Disposable cups are intended to be used only once.<br/><br/><strong>metal</strong><strong>: </strong>The thermal conductivity of metals is useful for containers to heat materials over a flame.<br/>and neutron irradiation resistant parts for nuclear applications.<br/>Electrical power grids rely on metal cables to distribute electricity.<br/>Home electrical systems, for the most part, are wired with copper wire for its good conducting properties.<br/>The Gilchrist-Thomas process (or basic Bessemer process) was an improvement to the Bessemer process, made by lining the converter with a basic material to remove phosphorus.<br/>Metals are also used for heat sinks to protect sensitive equipment from overheating.<br/>Initially, bronze was made of copper and arsenic (forming arsenic bronze) by smelting naturally or artificially mixed ores of copper and arsenic.<br/>The metal drum setup is generally much larger than those employed in other forms of rock music.<br/>With one exception, metallic elements reduce their electrical conductivity when heated.<br/>Currently the most important applications rely on the special magnetic properties of some ferromagnetic metallic glasses.<br/><br/><strong>clay</strong><strong>: </strong>These plates are tough but flexible, and in moist clay, they adhere to each other.<br/>In kaolinite clay, the bonding between plates is provided by a film of water molecules that hydrogen bond the plates together.<br/>High-quality clay is also tough, as measured by the amount of mechanical work required to roll a sample of clay flat.<br/>Cooking pots, art objects, dishware, smoking pipes, and even musical instruments such as the ocarina can all be shaped from clay before being fired.<br/>When the clay is fired to the earthenware stage, a dehydration reaction removes additional water from the clay, causing clay plates to irreversibly adhere to each other via stronger covalent bonding, which strengthens the material.<br/>Between one-half and two-thirds of the world's population still live or work in buildings made with clay, often baked into brick, as an essential part of its load-bearing structure.<br/>Between one-half and two-thirds of the world's population, in both traditional societies as well as developed countries, still live or work in buildings made with clay, often baked into brick, as an essential part of its load-bearing structure.<br/>However, most clay deposits are impure.<br/>If the clay is moistened again, it will once more become plastic.<br/>The defining mechanical property of clay is its plasticity when wet and its ability to harden when dried or fired.<br/><br/><strong>the measuring cup</strong><strong>: </strong>Measuring cups may be made of plastic, glass, or metal.<br/>Liquid measure cups tend to be microwave safe for heating and clear to more easily judge the meniscus.<br/>Many European measuring cups have markings that indicate the weight of common ingredients for a given volume.<br/>WBUR story on a measuring cup design which keep a perfect ratio of surface area to volume, for consistent accuracy.<br/>Because actual drinking cups may differ greatly from the size of this unit, standard measuring cups are usually used instead.<br/>Measuring cups usually have capacities from 250 mL (approx.<br/>Measuring cups are also used to measure washing powder, liquid detergents and bleach for clothes washing.<br/>They usually have scale markings at different heights: the substance being measured is added to the cup until it reaches the wanted level.<br/>Black and Decker models, have markings for both water and brewed coffee as the carafe is also used for measuring water prior to brewing.<br/>In the United States, the customary cup is half of a liquid pint.<br/><br/><strong>the measuring</strong><strong>: </strong>Measuring spoons may be made of plastic, metal, and other materials.<br/>Measuring cup.<br/>Measuring with cutlery spoons.<br/>, measuring spoons often come in sets, usually between four and six.<br/>Metric measuring spoons are available in sets, usually between four and six, typically with decilitre (100 ml), tablespoon (15 ml), teaspoon (5 ml) and millilitre measures.<br/>As cutlery, these spoons are not standardized and may hold 2.<br/>For fractional measures, there is often a line inside to indicate \"half\" or \"a quarter\", or a separate measure may be included, like \u200b1\u20442 dl.<br/>The difference in size can be dangerous when used for critical measuring, like medication.<br/>The volume of a traditional US teaspoon is 4.<br/>The Bertolt Brecht play, Round Heads and Pointed Heads, was originally written as an adaptation of Measure for Measure.<br/><br/><strong>rubber</strong><strong>: </strong>Indian rubber balls or lacrosse balls are made of rubber.<br/>The cups are supported by a wire that encircles the tree.<br/>Once the rubber is vulcanized, it is a thermoset.<br/>The ball is usually made from 100% rubber bands, but some instructions call for using a marble or a ping-pong ball as a starting point.<br/>In stretched rubber, the chains are almost linear.<br/>The latex is led into the cup by a galvanised \"spout\" knocked into the bark.<br/>In animal husbandry, rubber bands are used for docking and castration of livestock.<br/>Most rubber bands are manufactured out of natural rubber or, especially at larger sizes, elastomer, and are sold in a variety of sizes.<br/>Because of their electrical resistance, soft rubber goods are used as insulation and for protective gloves, shoes and blankets.<br/>The biomembrane is held tightly to the rubber core due to the high negative charge along the double bonds of the rubber polymer backbone.<br/><br/><strong>microwave,microwave oven</strong><strong>: </strong>In a similar way,

allows this to be easily done at home.<br/>Some current plastic containers and food wraps are specifically designed to resist radiation from microwaves.<br/>Frozen dinners, pies, and microwave popcorn bags often contain a susceptor made from thin aluminium film in the packaging or included on a small paper tray.<br/>Some ovens use high speed air.<br/>Some other objects that may conduct sparks are plastic/holographic print thermoses (such as Starbucks novelty cups) or cups with metal lining.<br/>Some microwavable packages (notably pies) may include materials that contain ceramic or aluminium flakes, which are designed to absorb microwaves and heat up, which aids in baking or crust preparation by depositing more energy shallowly in these areas.<br/>The metal film absorbs microwave energy efficiently and consequently becomes extremely hot and radiates in the infrared, concentrating the heating of oil for popcorn or even browning surfaces of frozen foods.<br/><br/><strong>home appliance</strong><strong>: </strong>Some such appliances were traditionally finished with genuine or imitation wood, hence the name.<br/>\"New computerized home appliance to assist with caring for the elderly\".<br/>Small appliances are typically small household electrical machines, also very useful and easily carried and installed.<br/>This categorization is reflected in the maintenance and repair of these types of products.<br/>It involves disassembly, removal of hazardous components and destruction of the equipment to recover materials, generally by shredding, sorting and grading.<br/>The main types of appliances that are recycled are T.<br/>White goods were typically painted or enameled white, and many of them still are.<br/>See Life spans of home appliances.<br/>Given a broad usage, the domestic application attached to home appliance is tied to the definition of appliance as \"an instrument or device designed for a particular use or

is, God has always been with them the entire time.<br/><br/><strong>overcast</strong><strong>: </strong>Sometimes clouds can be different colors such as black or white, but overcast usually refers to darker skies.<br/>Periods of overcast weather can range from a few hours to several days.<br/>In some cases, it can be impossible to see distinct borders of clouds or the sky may be covered by a single type of cloud, such as stratus and the whole sky will be a dull white.<br/>An overcast sky may be explicitly identified as thin (mostly transparent), but otherwise is considered opaque, which always constitutes a ceiling in aviation meteorology.<br/>However, the total cloud cover must not be entirely due to obscuring phenomena near the surface, such as fog.<br/>The same weather, when observed from above, might be referred to as (an) undercast.<br/>Overcast, written as \"OVC\" in the METAR observation, is reported when the cloud cover is observed to equal eight oktas (eighths).<br/>Overcast or overcast weather, as defined by the World Meteorological Organization, is the meteorological condition of clouds obscuring at least 95% of the sky.<br/>Overcast weather can also affect people suffering from seasonal affective disorder.<br/>Forward scatter.<br/><br/><strong>rain</strong><strong>: </strong>What are clouds, and why does it rain?.<br/>In temperate climates, people tend to be more stressed when the weather is unstable or cloudy, with its impact greater on men than women.<br/>If one wants an accumulated rainfall over a time period, one has to add up all the accumulations from each grid box within the images during that time.<br/>leeward sides are drier and sunnier, with less rain and less cloud cover.<br/>A common biome in this area is the tundra which has a short summer thaw and a long frozen winter.<br/>The forecasts can be verified through use of rain gauge measurements, weather radar estimates, or a combination of both.<br/>BBC article on the mathematics of running in the rain.<br/>In addition, because of the great temperature difference between cloud and ground level, these ice crystals may melt as they fall and become rain.<br/>In certain conditions precipitation may fall from a cloud but then evaporate or sublime before reaching the ground.<br/>In areas with wet and dry seasons, soil nutrients diminish and erosion increases during the wet season.<br/><br/><strong>bear</strong><strong>: </strong>When a black bear sees a grizzly coming, it either turns tail and runs or climbs a tree.<br/>Many Native American tribes both respect and fear the brown bear.<br/>For example, many Pacific coastal islands off British Columbia and Alaska support either the black bear or the grizzly, but rarely both.<br/>Sun bears use their long tongues to lick up both insects and honey.<br/>When a grizzly descends on a cougar feeding on its kill, the cougar usually gives way to the bear.<br/>Berries may be foraged in bushes or at the tops of trees, and bears try to maximize the number of berries consumed versus foliage.<br/>a black bear's rump is higher than its shoulders.<br/>20 to 30 grizzlies can be observed at the creek at one time and like Brooks Camp, visitors can watch bears from an above platform.<br/>Mothers may see their cubs in later years but both avoid each other.<br/>When this happens, it is usually with the grizzly being the aggressor.<br/><br/><strong>blanket</strong><strong>: </strong>Their design reduces the heat loss in a person's body, which would otherwise occur due to thermal radiation, water evaporation, or convection.<br/>Wearing a space blanket produced an insignificantly slower cooling rate after running in hot, humid conditions.<br/>Are Space Blankets Worth Having?.<br/>Many children and adults use a blanket as a comfort object.<br/>Space blankets are often given to marathoners and other endurance athletes at the end of races, or while waiting before races if the weather is chilly.<br/>Lost campers and hikers have an additional possible benefit: the shiny surface flashes in the sun, allowing its use as an improvised distress beacon for searchers and as a method of signalling over long distances to other people.<br/>Small children (and some adults) may also use a blanket as a comfort object.<br/>Their low weight and compact size before unfurling make them ideal when space or weight are at a premium.<br/>Blankets may be spread on the ground for a picnic or where people want to sit in a grassy or muddy area without soiling their clothing.<br/>It traps radiant bodily heat that otherwise would be lost through convection, helping to keep the user warm.<br/><br/><strong>dark</strong><strong>: </strong>when all three components are unilluminated (0,0,0), the pixel appears black.<br/>An object may appear dark, but it may be bright at a frequency that humans cannot perceive.<br/>Such shapes draw the eye around areas of the painting.<br/>When the red, green, and blue components of a pixel are fully illuminated (255,255,255), the pixel appears white.<br/>A dark area has limited light sources, making things hard to see.<br/>Human vision is unable to distinguish color in conditions of either high brightness or very low brightness.<br/>Artists use darkness to emphasize and contrast the presence of light.<br/>The word dark eventually evolved from the word deorc.<br/>The perception of darkness differs from the mere absence of light due to the effects of after images on perception.<br/>Exposure to alternating light and darkness (night and day) has caused several evolutionary adaptations to darkness.<br/><br/>", "concept": "<strong>rain</strong><strong>: </strong>liquid sunshine is related to rain<br/>washing your car causes it to

used?", "wiki": "<strong>white goat</strong><strong>: </strong>The Tibetan plateau goats are kept for down production.<br/>They are raised for cashmere production and used as pack animals.<br/>Most common goat breeds, including dairy goats, grow this two-coated fleece.<br/>The developers of the breed claim the lustre of the fleece is better than the Liaoning goat.<br/>About 60% of the goats are white.<br/>This dual-purpose goat is found in the L\u00fcliang area.<br/>The goats can be divided into five strains, Alasan (Alashanzuoqi), Arbus, Erlangshan, Hanshan and Wuzhumuqin.<br/>The foundation stock for the Australian Cashmere Goat was taken from northern and western Australia from the local bush goat population in the late 1970s.<br/>In the past decades, breeding programs have been started to develop productive breeds.<br/>The herd has been continually developed since then, and used to improve the cashmere herd throughout China.<br/><br/><strong>wool</strong><strong>: </strong>This semigrease wool can be worked into yarn and knitted into particularly water-resistant mittens or sweaters, such as those of the Aran Island fishermen.<br/>As an animal protein, wool can be used as a soil fertilizer, being a slow-release source of nitrogen.<br/>Damage or breaks in the wool can occur if the sheep is stressed while it is growing its fleece, resulting in a thin spot where the fleece is likely to break.<br/>Lanolin removed from wool is widely used in cosmetic products, such as hand creams.<br/>On sheep, the hair part of the fleece is called kemp.<br/>Australia is a leading producer of wool which is mostly from Merino sheep but has been eclipsed by China in terms of total weight.<br/>Breeds such as Lincoln, Romney, Drysdale, and Elliotdale produce coarser fibers, and wool from these sheep is usually used for making carpets.<br/>Such yarns are typically used as weft yarns with a cotton warp.<br/>The quality of fleeces is determined by a technique known as wool classing, whereby a qualified person, called a wool classer, groups wools of similar grading together to maximize the return for the farmer or sheep owner.<br/>The sheepwalks of Castile  were controlled by the Mesta union of sheep owners.<br/><br/><strong>sweater</strong><strong>: </strong>Sports sweaters are often worn on tops of sports kit while traveling to or from a sports ground.<br/>Some women's sweaters are meant to be worn belted.<br/>Even when such shaping is used, it can be knit into the fabric itself, without requiring seams.<br/>Sweaters are often maintained by washing or dry cleaning and the use of a lint roller or pill razor.<br/>Thin sweaters may be worn tucked into the waistband of trousers.<br/>a belt or drawstring is sometimes knitted into the sweater itself.<br/>Sweaters can be worn with a dress shirt underneath (and optionally a tie), which has the advantage of allowing the wearer to have the option of removing the sweater when it is uncomfortably warm and still looking presentable in many situations.<br/>Leggings are commonly worn with long sweaters or sweater dresses.<br/>The use of detergent is in fact detrimental because it removes the lanolin, which helps the wool to repel and shed dirt as well as water.<br/>Sweaters were traditionally made from wool but can now be made of cotton, synthetic fibers, or any combination of these.<br/><br/><strong>terrestrial animal</strong><strong>: </strong>They are adapted to most of the habitats on Earth.<br/>Saxicolous creatures are rock dwelling.<br/>Many animals considered terrestrial have a life-cycle that is partly dependent on being in water.<br/>Most terrestrialization events have occurred during the Paleozoic or Mesozoic.<br/>Some members of rissooidean families Truncatellidae, Assimineidae, and Pomatiopsidae are considered to have colonized to land during the Cenozoic.<br/>Evolution and adaptation of terrestrial arthropods.<br/>Nematodes are usually microscopic with this lifestyle.<br/>Terrestrial reconnaissance, a type of reconnaissance that is employed along the elements of ground warfare.<br/>In terrestrial habitats they are subjected to daily and seasonal variation in temperature and water availability.<br/>Many microscopic crustacean groups like copepods and amphipods (of which Sandhoppers are members) and Seed Shrimp are known to go dormant when dry and live in transient bodies of water too.<br/><br/><strong>fleece</strong><strong>: </strong>Alternatively, the fleeces would be used on washing tables in alluvial mining of gold or on washing tables at deep gold mines.<br/>The fleece is a symbol of authority and kingship.<br/>The golden fleece was defended by bulls with hoofs of brass and breath of fire.<br/>Fleeces, woollen coats of a domestic sheep or long-haired goat, especially after being shorn.<br/>The fleeces would be hung in trees to dry before the gold was shaken or combed out.<br/>It represents a breed of sheep in ancient Georgia.<br/>Horticultural fleece, a polypropylene fabric used to protect plants.<br/>The dragon was at the foot of the tree on which the fleece was placed.<br/>It represents the riches imported from the East.<br/>The following are the chief among the various interpretations of the fleece, with notes on sources and major critical discussions:.<br/><br/><strong>fur</strong><strong>: </strong>The hair of sheep is commonly referred to as wool, rather than fur.<br/>The use of fur as clothing or decoration is controversial.<br/>The fur of mammals has many uses: protection, sensory purposes, waterproofing, and camouflaging, with the primary usage being thermoregulation.<br/>Fur is also used to make felt.<br/>Today fur and trim used in garments may be dyed bright colors or to mimic exotic animal patterns, or shorn close like velvet.<br/>Two ships were sent out in 1668.<br/>The fur farming industry is present in many parts of Canada.<br/>The awn hair can be thought of as a hybrid, bridging the gap between the distinctly different characteristics of down and guard hairs.<br/>Pelts were worn in or out, depending on their characteristics and desired use.<br/>The denseness of fur can increase an animal's insulation value, and arctic mammals especially have dense fur.<br/><br/><strong>goat</strong><strong>: </strong>Milk from goats is often turned into goat cheese.<br/>Its horns can be used instead of sheep's horn to make a shofar.<br/>Goats have been used for milk, meat, fur, and skins across much of the world.<br/>Excess male kids of dairy breeds are typically slaughtered for meat.<br/>Some goats are bred specifically for milk.<br/>The intestine of goats is used to make \"catgut\", which is still in use as a material for internal human surgical sutures and strings for musical instruments.<br/>The miniature dairy goats may be judged by either of the two scorecards.<br/>These methods of herding are still used today.<br/>The horn of the goat, which signifies plenty and wellbeing (the cornucopia), is also used to make spoons.<br/>In various places in China, goats are used in the production of tea.<br/><br/><strong>sheep</strong><strong>: </strong>roughly six sheep can be kept on the amount that would suffice for a single cow or horse.<br/>Long wool sheep are most valued for crossbreeding to improve the attributes of other sheep types.<br/>Sheep have been used as pack animals.<br/>Fleeces are used as material in making alternative products such as wool insulation.<br/>A sheep's wool is the most widely used animal fiber, and is usually harvested by shearing.<br/>\" Almost all sheep are classified as being best suited to furnishing a certain product: wool, meat, milk, hides, or a combination in a dual-purpose breed.<br/>Dual-purpose breeds that may primarily be meat or wool sheep are often used secondarily as milking animals, but there are a few breeds that are predominantly used for milking.<br/>much sheep behavior can be understood on the basis of these tendencies.<br/>As the demand for carpet-quality wool declines, some breeders of this type of sheep are attempting to use a few of these traditional breeds for alternative purposes.<br/>Domestic sheep provide a wide array of raw materials.<br/><br/><strong>sheer</strong><strong>: </strong>Sheering village is situated 2.<br/>Sheers, a form of two-legged lifting device.<br/>Sheer curation, a lightweight approach to digital curation.<br/>The Stort Navigation to the west has a lock at Sheering Mill.<br/>Four other buildings  in the parish are Grade II* listed.<br/>Sheer fabric, a semi-transparent and flimsy fabric.<br/>The Hundred Parishes.<br/>Lower Sheering, adjacent to Sawbridgeworth in Hertfordshire and its railway station, forms part of the civil parish.<br/>Harry Goschen, baronet of Durrington House in the Parish of Sheering and County of Essex.<br/>Sheering village has approximately 350 households.<br/><br/><strong>white box</strong><strong>: </strong>White-box testing can be applied at the unit, integration and system levels of the software testing process.<br/>Side effects of having the knowledge of the source code is beneficial to thorough testing.<br/>White-box testing is one of the two biggest testing methods used today.<br/>The code under test could be rewritten to implement the same functionality in a different way that invalidates the assumptions baked into the test.<br/>Optimization of code becomes easy as inconspicuous bottlenecks are exposed.<br/>Easy to automate.<br/>Once the source code is understood then the source code can be analyzed for test cases to be created.<br/>The resulting test can be fragile because they are tightly coupled to the specific implementation of the thing being tested.<br/>It can test paths within a unit, paths between units during integration, and between subsystems during a system\u2013level test.<br/>These test cases are derived through the use of the design techniques mentioned above: control flow testing, data flow testing, branch testing, path testing, statement coverage and decision coverage as well as modified condition/decision coverage.<br/><br/><strong>shear</strong><strong>: </strong>Also constructions in soil can fail due to shear.<br/>This relationship can be exploited to measure the wall shear stress.<br/>Semi-monocoque shear.<br/>Sheep shearing.<br/>The removal of nap during wool cloth production.<br/>The measured value of wall velocity gradient is independent of the fluid properties and as a result does not require calibration.<br/>Specifically, the wall shear stress is defined as:.<br/>The signal can be processed, and knowing the fringe angle, the height and velocity of the

spiritualists also became practitioners of the new art form.<br/>Therefore, it is necessary to either stack polyester protected photographs horizontally within a box, or bind them in a three ring binder.<br/>Originally, all photographs were monochromatic or hand-painted in color.<br/>users tend to handle plastic enclosed photographs less gently than non-enclosed photographs, simply because they feel the plastic enclosure makes the photo impervious to all mishandling.<br/>Alternatively, the film is processed to invert the negative image, yielding positive transparencies.<br/>The very nature of enclosing a photograph in plastic encourages users to pick it up.<br/>Stacking the photos horizontally within a flat box will greatly reduce ease of access, and binders leave three sides of the photo exposed to the effects of light and do not support the photograph evenly on both sides, leading to slumping and bending within the binder.<br/>If for some reason the researcher or archivist

person popularly dubbed the \"umbrella man\" has been the object of much speculation, as he was the only person seen carrying, and opening, an umbrella on that sunny day.<br/>He claimed still to have the umbrella and did not know he had been the subject of controversy.<br/>As Kennedy's limousine approached, the man opened up and lifted the umbrella high above his head, then spun or panned the umbrella from east to west (clockwise) as the president passed by him.<br/>Early speculation came from assassination researchers Josiah Thompson and Richard Sprague who noticed the open umbrella in a series of photographs.<br/>In the aftermath of the assassination, the \"umbrella man\" sat down on the sidewalk next to another man before getting up and walking towards the Texas School Book Depository.<br/>Thompson and Sprague suggested that the \"umbrella man\" may have been acting as a signaler of some kind, opening his umbrella to signal \"go ahead\" and then raising it to communicate

infection by insects such as Leptoglossus clypealis.<br/>Pistachio trees do poorly in conditions of high humidity and are susceptible to root rot in winter if they get too much water and the soil is not sufficiently free-draining.<br/>Pistachio trees are fairly hardy in the right conditions and can survive temperatures ranging between \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) in winter and 48 \u00b0C (118 \u00b0F) in summer.<br/>Pistachio trees were introduced from Asia to Europe in the 1st Century AD by the Romans.<br/>Pistachio shells typically split naturally prior to harvest, with a hull covering the intact seeds.<br/>Pistachio pudding, a green pudding made from pistachio nuts.<br/>Originally, dye was applied by importers to hide stains on the shells caused when the seeds were picked by hand.<br/>Pistachio consumption appears to modestly lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure in persons without diabetes mellitus.<br/>Long, hot summers are required for proper ripening of the fruit.<br/><br/><strong>plastic battery</strong><strong>: </strong>Another method is a plastic channel to receive a battery post or terminal.<br/>Where the battery is expected to last over the life of the product, no holder is necessary, and a tab welded to the battery terminals can be directly soldered to a printed circuit board.<br/>External connections on battery holders are usually made by contacts with pins, surface mount feet, solder lugs, or wire leads.<br/>For wet cells, cables are often connected to the battery terminals, as is found in automobiles or emergency lighting equipment.<br/>The contact for the anode side can be recessed behind plastic and receive a battery nub common on alkaline batteries.<br/>Most current battery holders are made with polypropylene or nylon bodies rated for 80\u2013100 \u00b0C (176\u2013212 \u00b0F).<br/>Design of the battery holder requires knowledge of how and where the larger product will be used.<br/>the spring contact compresses and allows the battery to move away from the fixed contact.<br/>The electronics industry now uses many surface mounted lithium battery holders or sockets.<br/>Battery holders for zinc-air batteries must not be completely air-tight since approximately 1 litre of air is required per ampere-hour of discharge per cell.<br/><br/><strong>gadget</strong><strong>: </strong>The minimum of skills is required in its installation and use, and it is independent of any physical or social infrastructure beyond that by which it may be ordered from catalogue and delivered to its prospective user.<br/>The word widget is older in this context.<br/>No follow-up issues have been released to date.<br/>The 'jigger' or short-rest used in billiards is also often called a 'gadget'.<br/>The production values of this series were higher than any of the previous revivals and spinoff series.<br/>Gadgets were first used in the late 18th century.<br/>Even though the film uses the same

to animals that digest their food inside their bodies.<br/>Young babies eat pureed baby foods because they have few teeth and immature digestive systems.<br/>Animals and other heterotrophs must eat in order to survive \u2014 carnivores eat other animals, herbivores eat plants, omnivores consume a mixture of both plant and animal matter, and detritivores eat detritus.<br/>Newborn babies do not eat adult foods.<br/>The environmental signals come from the body's senses.<br/>For humans, eating is an activity of daily living.<br/>Some individuals may limit their amount of nutritional intake.<br/>They survive solely on breast milk or formula.<br/>Conversely, snacks are usually eaten alone.<br/><br/><strong>leaf</strong><strong>: </strong>Other herbivores and their predators mimic the appearance of the leaf.<br/>Accordingly, leaves are prominent in the diet of many animals.<br/>Animals that are specialized to eat leaves are known as folivores.<br/>Some species have cryptic adaptations by which they use leaves in avoiding predators.<br/>Some sawflies similarly roll the leaves of their food plants into tubes.<br/>Some structures of non-vascular plants look and function much like leaves.<br/>Not every species produces leaves with all of these structural components.<br/>In many aquatic species, the leaves are submerged in water.<br/>Many gymnosperms have thin needle-like or scale-like leaves that can be advantageous in cold climates with frequent snow and frost.<br/>Green plants are autotrophic, meaning that they do not obtain food from other living things but instead create their own food by photosynthesis.<br/><br/><strong>these animals</strong><strong>: </strong>Most animals rely on the biomass and energy produced by plants through photosynthesis.<br/>Other animals may have very specific feeding behaviours, such as hawksbill sea turtles primarily eating sponges.<br/>Several animals are microscopic.<br/>Some animals are capable of asexual reproduction, which often results in a genetic clone of the parent.<br/>Herbivores eat plant material directly, while carnivores, and other animals on higher trophic levels typically acquire it indirectly by eating other animals.<br/>Nearly all animals make use of some form of sexual reproduction.<br/>All animals are motile (able to spontaneously move their bodies) during at least part of their life cycle, but some animals, such as sponges, corals, mussels, and barnacles, later become sessile.<br/>Several animal phyla lack bilateral symmetry.<br/>All animals are composed of cells, surrounded by a characteristic extracellular matrix composed of collagen and elastic glycoproteins.<br/>With very few exceptions, animals respire aerobically.<br/><br/><strong>head</strong><strong>: </strong>Other animals.<br/>Some very simple animals may not have a head, but many bilaterally symmetric forms do, regardless of size.<br/>Insects have mouth parts in various shapes depending on their feeding habits.<br/>In bilaterally symmetrical animals, nervous tissues concentrate at the anterior region, forming structures responsible for information processing.<br/>A typical insect head is composed of eyes, antennae, and components of mouth.<br/>Heads develop in animals by an evolutionary trend known as cephalization.<br/>Though invertebrate chordates \u2013 such as the tunicate larvae or the lancelets \u2013 have heads, there has been a question of how the vertebrate head, characterized by a bony skull clearly separated from the main body, might have evolved from the head structures of these animals.<br/>The heads of humans and other animals are commonly recurring charges in heraldry.<br/>Now all tennis balls are produced in China.<br/>According to Hyman (1979), the evolution of the head in the vertebrates has occurred by the fusion of a fixed number of anterior segments, in the same manner as in other \"heteronomously segmented animals\".<br/><br/><strong>plant</strong><strong>: </strong>Many animals rely on plants for shelter as well as oxygen and food.<br/>Many animals pollinate flowers in exchange for food in the form of pollen or nectar.<br/>Numerous animals have coevolved with plants.<br/>Other organisms form mutually beneficial relationships with plants.<br/>Many animals disperse seeds, often by eating fruit and passing the seeds in their feces.<br/>Humans depend on plants for food, either directly or as feed for domestic animals.<br/>many tropical plants lose their leaves during the dry season.<br/>Some plants reproduce sexually, some asexually, and some via both means.<br/>Herbivores eat plants, but plants can defend themselves and some species are parasitic or even carnivorous.<br/>Some mosses grow less than 0.<br/><br/><strong>grass</strong><strong>: </strong>Many types of animals eat grass as their main source of food, and are called graminivores \u2013 these include cattle, sheep, horses, rabbits and many invertebrates, such as grasshoppers and the caterpillars of many brown butterflies.<br/>Grasses are also eaten by omnivorous or even occasionally by primarily carnivorous animals.<br/>The evolution of large grazing animals in the Cenozoic contributed to the spread of grasses.<br/>The leaf blades of many grasses are hardened with silica phytoliths, which discourage grazing animals.<br/>Grass, plants growing in the ground.<br/>Many species of grass are grown as pasture for foraging or as fodder for prescribed livestock feeds, particularly in the case of cattle, horses, and sheep.<br/>hence, grasses can quickly recover from cropping at the top.<br/>Straw (and sometimes hay) may also be used as bedding for animals.<br/>The C4 grasses have a photosynthetic pathway, linked to specialized Kranz leaf anatomy, which allows for increased water use efficiency, rendering them better adapted to hot, arid environments.<br/>Trampling grazers kill seedling trees but not grasses.<br/><br/><strong>peanut</strong><strong>: </strong>Most Indians use mustard, sunflower, and peanut oil for cooking.<br/>As animal food.<br/>Eating a small amount of peanut can cause a reaction.<br/>The domesticated plants are bushier and more compact, and have a different pod structure and larger seeds.<br/>Many pre-Columbian cultures, such as the Moche, depicted peanuts in their art.<br/>Meanwhile, the hearts of peanuts are segregated through inspection.<br/>Spanish peanuts have a higher oil content than other types of peanuts.<br/>Virginia group peanuts are either bunch or running in growth habit.<br/>Some peanuts can also be fed whole to livestock, for example those in excess of the peanut quota in the US, or those with a higher aflatoxin content than that permitted by the food regulations.<br/>The most important diseases are leaf spots, rusts and the toxin-producing fungus Aspergillus.<br/><br/><strong>elephant</strong><strong>: </strong>African forest elephants ingest and defecate seeds, with either no effect or a positive effect on germination.<br/>These animals were relatively small and aquatic.<br/>The animal's field of vision is compromised by the location and limited mobility of the eyes.<br/>One elephant has been observed to graze by kneeling on its front legs, raising on its hind legs and taking in grass with its lips.<br/>These animals do not reproduce well in captivity, due to the difficulty of handling musth bulls and limited understanding of female oestrous cycles.<br/>An elephant uses mud as a sunscreen, protecting its skin from ultraviolet light.<br/>These animals are typically captured from the wild when they are 10\u201320 years old when they can be trained quickly and easily, and will have a longer working life.<br/>They browse more in the dry season with bark constituting a major part of their diet in the cool part of that season.<br/>Working animal.<br/>The animal's sense of smell may be four times as sensitive as that of a bloodhound.<br/><br/><strong>hay</strong><strong>: </strong>Most animals are fed hay in two daily feedings, morning and evening.<br/>Some animals are sensitive to particular fungi or molds that may grow on living plants.<br/>Different animals also use hay in different ways: cattle evolved to eat forages in relatively large quantities at a single feeding, and then, due to the process of rumination, take a considerable amount of time for their stomachs to digest food, often accomplished while the animal is lying down, at rest.<br/>Both types of animals can digest cellulose in grass and hay, but do so by different mechanisms.<br/>Some animals, especially those being raised for meat, may be given enough hay that they simply are able to eat all day.<br/>Some animals are also fed concentrated feeds such as grain or vitamin supplements in addition to hay.<br/>Other animals, especially those that are ridden or driven as working animals, are only free to eat when not working, and may be given a more limited amount of hay to prevent them from getting too fat.<br/>Some plants themselves may also be toxic to some animals.<br/>They require three to four hours per day to eat enough hay to meet their nutritional requirements.<br/>Therefore, different types of animals require hay that consists of similar plants to what they would eat while grazing, and likewise, plants that are toxic to an animal in pasture are also toxic if they are dried into hay.<br/><br/>", "concept": "<strong>peanut</strong><strong>: </strong>peanut milk is related

USB ports for iPod connectivity, and an easier to control handset.<br/><br/><strong>travel</strong><strong>: </strong>many countries have penalties for violating seatbelt laws.<br/>however most countries accept international driving permits.<br/>Motives for travel include:.<br/>Many countries do not recognize drivers' licenses from other countries.<br/>Travellers may use human-powered transport such as walking or bicycling.<br/>to the 21st century where aircraft allow travel from Spain to the United States overnight.<br/>This link may reflect the extreme difficulty of travel in ancient times.<br/>or vehicles, such as public transport, automobiles, trains and airplanes.<br/>Wearing a seat belt is highly advisable for safety reasons.<br/>It is also advisable to become oriented with the driving rules and -regulations of destination countries.<br/><br/><strong>land</strong><strong>: </strong>The height of the land is important in creating and transforming airflow and precipitation on Earth.<br/>The division between land and water is a fundamental concept to humans.<br/>but this proportion is decreased by the land's increased terrain.<br/>The latitude of the land will influence how much solar radiation reaches the surface.<br/>The land of the Earth interacts with and influences climate heavily since the surface of the land heats up and cools down faster than air or water.<br/>These inner planets have a rocky surface with metal interiors.<br/>Such systems had design flaws that would allow the device to accept request on the wire appearing to be from themselves, causing repeated replies.<br/>The atmosphere and oceans of the Earth continuously shape the land by eroding and transporting solids on the surface.<br/>Planetary bodies that have a thin atmosphere often have land that is marked by impact craters since atmospheric conditions would normally break-down incoming objects and erode rough impact sites.<br/>Most firewalls should intercept and discard the poison packet thus protecting the host from this attack.<br/><br/><strong>metal fence</strong><strong>: </strong>The fence is not designed to concentrate or channel stormwater.<br/>The design/placement of the silt fence should create a pooling of runoff, which then allows sedimentation to occur.<br/>Pet fence, an underground fence for pet containment.<br/>characteristically two courses of waler are added on the interior side to reinforce the wall.<br/>Around mast radiators, wooden fences are used to avoid the problem of eddy currents.<br/>The metal backing gives the fence increased strength to resist the weight of soil and water which may be trapped by the fence in a large drainage area, and discourages construction site operators from driving vehicles over the fence.<br/>Conversely, for common land, it is the surrounding landowners' duty to fence the common's livestock out such as in large parts of the New Forest.<br/>Otherwise it tends to be on non-owner's side so the fence owner might access the posts when repairs are needed but this is not a legal requirement.<br/>Silt fences are often installed as perimeter controls.<br/>Sand and silt tends to clog the fabric, and then the sediments settle in the temporary pond.<br/><br/><strong>the wheels</strong><strong>: </strong>Morrison was a member of the band, briefly, before they became known as the Wheels.<br/>The song is based on a vintage blues by Peter Chatman.<br/>The artwork for the album was by Martin Sharp who had also done the artwork for Disraeli Gears.<br/>Six shows were recorded in San Francisco by Pappalardi and recording engineer Bill Halverson, and extra performances not included on Wheels of Fire ended up on Live Cream and Live Cream Volume II.<br/>Felix Pappalardi \u2013 viola, bells, organ, trumpet, tonette.<br/>^Note 3:  Some songs on the studio album were processed with the Haeco-CSG system.<br/>The band's drummer Ginger Baker co-wrote three songs for the album with pianist Mike Taylor.<br/>Haeco-CSG was intended to make stereo recordings that were compatible with mono playback but has the unfortunate side effect of \"blurring\" the phantom centre channel.<br/>Tommy Scott, who had previously worked with Them, would produce their records for the label.<br/>In the UK the studio album art was black print on aluminium foil while the live album art was a negative image of the studio cover.<br/><br/><strong>plane</strong><strong>: </strong>Planing (boat), where weight is predominantly supported by hydrodynamic lift.<br/>The aircraft was later rented or sold to parties who later used it to smuggle drugs into the United States, and it crashed in a swamp on at least one occasion.<br/>The animated film is itself a general parody of the television series.<br/>It was one of the few Widgeons converted with radial engines.<br/>Ze Plane! Ze Plane! has at times been on display on the airshow circuit in the American Midwest, and was previously owned by the Ozarks Auto Show, Inc.<br/>The actual aircraft.<br/>Plane (tool), a tool for

of the plane.<br/>It was involved in a gear collapse accident in the 1990s and repainted deep red, so it is not as recognizable as Ze Plane of the television series when it was painted white.<br/><br/><strong>fly</strong><strong>: </strong>Some flies have functional mandibles that may be used for biting.<br/>Flies are capable of great manoeuvrability during flight due to the presence of the halteres.<br/>Most adult diptera have their mouthparts modified to sponge up fluid.<br/>Some plants are pollinated by fungus feeding flies that visit fungus infected male flowers.<br/>The larvae of many brachyceran families are predaceous.<br/>Some aquatic larvae consume the films of algae that form underwater on rocks and plants.<br/>Fly larvae can be used as a biomedical tool for wound care and treatment.<br/>Many dipterans serve roles that are useful to humans.<br/>The wings of the fly are attached to two kinds of muscles, those used to power it and another set used for fine control.<br/>Flies are adapted for aerial movement and typically have short and streamlined bodies.<br/><br/><strong>boeing</strong><strong>: </strong>This raised cockpit allows front loading of cargo on freight variants.<br/>The aircraft is certified to carry only essential crew and not passengers.<br/>The combi aircraft model, the 747-200M, could carry freight in the rear section of the main deck via a side cargo door.<br/>As the CX-HLS needed to be able to be loaded from the front, a door had to be included where the cockpit usually was.<br/>The main gear are redundant so that landing can be performed on two opposing landing gears if the others are not functioning properly.<br/>The 747 has redundant structures along with four redundant hydraulic systems and four main landing gears each with four wheels.<br/>The 747-300M features cargo capacity on the rear portion of the main deck, similar to the -200M, but with the stretched upper deck it can carry more passengers.<br/>Although the C-141 Starlifter was being introduced, officials believed that a much larger and more capable aircraft was needed, especially to carry cargo that would not fit in any existing aircraft.<br/>The -200C could also be outfitted with an optional side cargo door on the main deck.<br/>All of the companies solved this problem by moving the cockpit above the cargo area.<br/><br/><strong>wide-body aircraft</strong><strong>: </strong>Some wide-body aircraft have been modified to enable transport of especially large cargo.<br/>Some wide-body aircraft are used as VIP transport.<br/>The Trent 900 is designed to fit into a Boeing 747-400F freighter for easier transport by air cargo.<br/>Complete GE90 engines can only be ferried by outsize cargo aircraft such as the Antonov An-124, presenting logistics problems if a 777 is stranded in a place due to emergency diversions without the proper spare parts.<br/>In some of the largest single-deck wide-body aircraft, such as the Boeing 777, the extra space above the cabin is used for crew rest areas and galley storage.<br/>Wide-body aircraft were originally designed for a combination of efficiency and passenger comfort and to increase the amount of cargo space.<br/>Super- and heavy-category aircraft require greater separation behind them than those in other categories.<br/>Larger aircraft would have to be longer, higher (such as a double-deck), or wider in order to accommodate a greater number of passenger seats.<br/>Some wide-body aircraft are used as flying command posts by the military like the Ilyushin Il-80 or the Boeing E-4, while the Boeing E-767 is used for Airborne Early Warning and Control.<br/>Most modern wide-body aircraft have two engines, although the heaviest wide-body aircraft are built with four engines: the Airbus A380, Boeing 747-8.<br/><br/><strong>air travel</strong><strong>: </strong>Small piston engines can be modified to burn ethanol.<br/>Airlines rely either on the point-to-point model or the spoke-and-hub model to operate flights in between airports.<br/>Most air travel starts and ends at a commercial airport.<br/>Fish, macroinvertebrates and other aquatic organisms need sufficient dissolved oxygen levels in surface waters.<br/>A Continuous Descent Approach (CDA) is quieter as less noise is produced while the engines are near idle power.<br/>This argument in favor of air travel is counterweighted by two facts:.<br/>Higher bypass ratio engines produce less noise.<br/>For Collins Aerospace, this 1:50 ratio forbids electric propulsion for long-range aircraft.<br/>Modern air travel is much safer than road travel.<br/>Contrails are uncommon from lower-altitude aircraft.<br/><br/><strong>this vehicle</strong><strong>: </strong>Most land vehicles rely on friction for accelerating, decelerating and changing direction.<br/>Continuous track is sometimes used instead of wheels to power land vehicles.<br/>Many pedalo boats also use paddle wheels for propulsion.<br/>Most vehicles, with the notable exception of railed vehicles, have at least one steering mechanism.<br/>Similarly to propeller vehicles, some vehicles use wings for propulsion.<br/>Land vehicles are classified broadly by what is used to apply steering and drive forces against the ground: wheeled, tracked, railed or skied.<br/>It is essential that a vehicle have a source of energy to drive it.<br/>Wheeled vehicles steer by angling their front or rear wheels.<br/>By far, most vehicles use wheels which employ the principle of rolling to enable displacement with very little rolling friction.<br/>If this is done with battery EVs, the interior heating requires extra energy from the vehicles' batteries.<br/><br/><strong>airline</strong><strong>: </strong>Airlines usually prefer to purchase items visible to their passengers to differentiate themselves from local competitors.<br/>Airlines employ lawyers to deal with regulatory procedures and other administrative tasks.<br/>Most airlines employ a call sign that is normally spoken during airband radio transmissions.<br/>Early European airlines tended to favor comfort \u2013 the passenger cabins were often spacious with luxurious interiors \u2013 over speed and efficiency.<br/>The added efficiencies for these aircraft were often not in speed, but in passenger capacity, payload, and range.<br/>Some call signs are less obviously associated with a particular airline than others.<br/>Airlines assign prices to their services in an attempt to maximize profitability.<br/>Carriers often accomplish this by dividing each cabin of the aircraft (first, business and economy) into a number of travel classes for pricing purposes.<br/>Most airlines use differentiated pricing, a form of price discrimination, to sell air services at varying prices simultaneously to different segments.<br/>Airlines utilize aircraft to supply these services and may form partnerships or alliances with other airlines for codeshare agreements, in which they both offer and operate the same flight.<br/><br/><strong>cargo</strong><strong>: </strong>You can see the different types and weights of vehicles that are used to move cargo around.<br/>Most nations own and utilize large numbers of military cargo aircraft such as the C\u201117 Globemaster III for logistical needs.<br/>Such large aircraft employ quick-loading containers known as unit load devices (ULDs), much like containerized cargo ships.<br/>Many firms, like Parcelforce, FedEx and R+L Carriers transport all types of cargo by road.<br/>Eventually manufacturers started designing aircraft for other types of freight as well.<br/>Popular commercial aircraft transformed to a cargo aircraft such as Saab 340A is designed for high revenue and profitability in short / medium haul operations.<br/>However, air freight or air cargo shipments typically need to move at much faster speeds than 800 km or 497 mi per hour.<br/>Aircraft

level, respectively.<br/>The stope may be backfilled or left empty, depending on the rock conditions.<br/>Like shrinkage stoping, underhand stoping is most suitable for steeply dipping ore bodies.<br/>A slot is required in every stope to provide the initial void.<br/>It is common to dig shafts vertically downwards to reach the ore body and then drive horizontal levels through it.<br/>Long hole stoping.<br/><br/><strong>forehand</strong><strong>: </strong>It is particularly well-suited for hitting low balls \u2014 \"taking the ball on the rise\" \u2014 but is generally considered inferior for most forehands.<br/>It is often described as shaking hands with the racquet.<br/>Peng's forehand is also cross-handed.<br/>It is considered the easiest shot to master, perhaps because it is the most natural stroke.<br/>Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro is an excellent example of an eastern forehand user.<br/>It is currently the most popular forehand grip among ATP and WTA pros, with many top players employing this grip on their forehand.<br/>It contrasts with the backhand, the other type of groundstroke.<br/>There are four main grips for executing the forehand and their popularity has fluctuated over the years.<br/>It's considered by some to be too extreme for tennis, as the optimal strike zone for this grip is very high up and is suitable only for pure spin hitting.<br/>His power and versatility on the forehand side are commonly attributed to this twist on the forehand grip.<br/><br/><strong>backhand</strong><strong>: </strong>It is considered hard to be able to consistently pull off deep, low yet quick backhand slices and requires much practice and finesse.<br/>The slice backhand is considered the most simple and is the easiest to learn technique-wise.<br/>The backhand is usually performed from the baseline or as an approach shot.<br/>It is usually executed with an Eastern or Semi-Western grip, and involves a \"throw-back\" in which the racket is pulled across the player's body, sometimes with the help of the left hand, and a release to hit the ball followed by a much larger follow-through and finish as compared to the slice backhand.<br/>Other female players are known for their use of the slice backhand.<br/>However, the two-handed backhand provides more stability and power for the shot, and is increasingly used in the modern game.<br/>The top-spin single-handed backhand is probably the hardest to learn.<br/>He was one of the first players to use a flat single-handed backhand with a hint of top-spin.<br/>The backhand can be a one-handed or two-handed stroke.<br/>Many tennis greats use the one-handed backhand.<br/><br/><strong>consider</strong><strong>: </strong>The work was first published in the United

illness.<br/><br/><strong>tomato</strong><strong>: </strong>It was grown from the 18th century onwards for the British.<br/>However, even in areas where the climate supported growing tomatoes, their habit of growing to the ground suggested low status.<br/>This type of tomato is grown commercially near plants that process and can tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste.<br/>In California, tomatoes are grown under irrigation for both the fresh fruit market and for canning and processing.<br/>Today, the crop is grown in every state in the Union.<br/>The tomato is now grown and eaten around the world.<br/>Tomatoes were not grown in England until the 1590s.<br/>Tomatoes are often grown in greenhouses in cooler climates, and cultivars such as the British 'Moneymaker' and a number of cultivars grown in Siberia are specifically bred for indoor growing.<br/>It grew easily in Mediterranean climates, and cultivation began in the 1540s.<br/>They are harvested when ripe and are flavorful when picked.<br/><br/><strong>red strawberries</strong><strong>: </strong>It is also grown extensively near the town of Karadeniz Ere\u011fli in Zonguldak province, Turkey.<br/>Strawberries can also be grown indoors in strawberry pots.<br/>The first garden strawberry was grown in Brittany, France, during the late 18th century.<br/>The delicate strawberries are still harvested by hand.<br/>Alternatively they can be planted in pots or special planters using compost.<br/>They are produced in Kartuzy, Ko\u015bcierzyna and Byt\u00f3w counties and in the municipalities of Przywidz, Wejherowo, Luzino, Szemud, Linia, \u0141\u0119czyce and Cewice in Kashubia.<br/>Strawberries are tough and will survive many conditions, but during fruit formation, moisture is vital, especially if growing in containers.<br/>At the end of the harvest season, the plastic is removed and the plants are plowed into the ground.<br/>Grading and packing often occurs in the field, rather than in a processing facility.<br/>Some cultivars are bred for their ornamental value.<br/><br/><strong>green broccoli</strong><strong>: </strong>It is a cool-season annual crop.<br/>It is eaten either raw or cooked.<br/>It has a head shaped like cauliflower, but consisting of many tiny flower buds.<br/>In the United States, broccoli is grown year-round in California \u2013 which produced 92% of the crop nationally \u2013 with 95% of the total crop produced for fresh sales in 2018.<br/>a rapini festival (Feira do grelo) is held in the Galician town of As Pontes every February.<br/>It can be a component of pasta dishes, especially when accompanied by Italian sausage.<br/>It sometimes, but not always, has a purple cast to the tips of the flower buds.<br/>Broccoli is classified in the Italica cultivar group of the species Brassica oleracea.<br/>Rapini is widely used in southern Italian cuisine, in particular that of Sicily, Calabria, Campania, Apulia (Puglia), and Rome.<br/>The mass of flower heads is surrounded by leaves.<br/><br/><strong>carrot</strong><strong>: </strong>Carrots are grown from seed and can take up to four months (120 days) to mature, but most cultivars mature within 70 to 80 days under the right conditions.<br/>They grow best in full sun but tolerate some shade.<br/>Irrigation is applied when needed to keep the soil moist.<br/>The stem, located just above the ground, is compressed and the internodes are not distinct.<br/>Carrots can be stored for several months in the refrigerator or over winter in a moist, cool place.<br/>Imperator types are the most widely cultivated by commercial growers.<br/>Daucus carota is a biennial plant.<br/>The plant was introduced into Spain by the Moors in the 8th century.<br/>They were developed in 1871 in Danvers, Massachusetts.<br/>They are somewhat shorter than Imperator cultivars, but more tolerant of heavy soil conditions.<br/><br/>", "concept": "<strong>green broccoli</strong><strong>:

(till) of all sizes.<br/>Plains in many areas are important for agriculture because where the soils were deposited as sediments they may be deep and fertile, and the flatness facilitates mechanization of crop production.<br/>Erosional plains have been leveled by various agents of denudation such as running water, rivers, wind and glacier which wear out the rugged surface and smoothens them.<br/>They are structurally depressed areas of the world that make up some of the most extensive natural lowlands on the Earth's surface.<br/>Plains are one of the major landforms on earth, where they are present on all continents, and would cover more than one-third of the world's land area.<br/>Glacial plains, formed by the movement of glaciers under the force of gravity:.<br/>Coastal plains would mostly rise from sea level until they run into elevated features such as mountains or plateaus.<br/>The chord progressions are played twice for all verses followed by the power chords D5-Gsus2-Bbsus2 for all choruses.<br/>Machair \u2013 A fertile low-lying grassy plain.<br/>Planitia, the Latin word for plain, is used in the naming of plains on extraterrestrial objects (planets and moons), such as Hellas Planitia on Mars or Sedna Planitia on Venus.<br/><br/><strong>sleep</strong><strong>: </strong>Many cultural stories have been told about people falling asleep for extended periods of time.<br/>Some societies display a fragmented sleep pattern in which people sleep at all times of the day and night for shorter periods.<br/>Sleeping medications such as Ambien and Lunesta are an increasingly popular treatment for insomnia.<br/>Sleep is a highly conserved behavior across animal evolution.<br/>Process C counteracts the homeostatic drive for sleep during the day (in diurnal animals) and augments it at night.<br/>The use of artificial light has substantially altered humanity's sleep patterns.<br/>In many nomadic or hunter-gatherer societies, people will sleep on and off throughout the day or night depending on what is happening.<br/>In some societies, people sleep with at least one other person (sometimes many) or with animals.<br/>\" This theory is strengthened by the fact that sleep is observed to be a necessary behavior across most of the animal kingdom, including some of the least evolved animals which have no need for other functions of sleep, such as memory consolidation or dreaming.<br/>Bimodal sleep in humans was more common before the industrial revolution.<br/><br/><strong>terrestrial animal</strong><strong>: </strong>Many animals considered terrestrial have a life-cycle that is partly dependent on being in water.<br/>They are adapted to most of the habitats on Earth.<br/>Many microscopic crustacean groups like copepods and amphipods (of which Sandhoppers are members) and Seed Shrimp are known to go dormant when dry and live in transient bodies of water too.<br/>Additionally many microscopic crustacean groups like copepods and amphipods (of which Sandhoppers are members) and Seed Shrimp are known to go dormant when dry and live in transient bodies of water.<br/>Many animals live in terrestrial environments by thriving in transient often microscopic bodies of water and moisture, these include Rotifers and Gastrotrichs which lay resilient eggs capable of surviving years in dry environments, and some of which can go dormant themselves.<br/>Saxicolous creatures are rock dwelling.<br/>Penguins, seals, and walruses sleep on land and feed in the ocean, yet they are all considered terrestrial.<br/>Gastropod mollusks are one of the most successful animals that have diversified in the fully terrestrial habitat.<br/>Labeling an animal species \"terrestrial\" or \"aquatic\" is often obscure and becomes a matter of judgment.<br/>The transition from an aquatic to terrestrial life has evolved independently and successfully many times by various groups of animals.<br/><br/><strong>zebra</strong><strong>: </strong>The animals keep watch for predators.<br/>They are known for being among the last animals to be featured in the dictionary and in children's alphabet books where they are often used to represent the letter 'Z'.<br/>Plains zebras are adapted for grazing on both long, tough grass stems and newly emerging short grass.<br/>The zebra also gained a reputation for being ill-tempered and kicked at visitors.<br/>However, zebra young are afforded more protection then those of species like wildebeest and hartebeest.<br/>Zebras have been popular in photography, with some wildlife photographers describing them as the most photogenic animal.<br/>Plains zebras are more water-dependent and live in more mesic environments than other species.<br/>They regularly rub against trees, rocks, and other objects and roll around in dust for protection against flies and irritation.<br/>Their dentition is adapted for grazing.<br/>Zebra species have two basic social structures.<br/><br/><strong>protection</strong><strong>: </strong>Both humans and animals are also often concerned with the protection of others, with adult animals being particularly inclined to seek to protect their young from elements of nature and from predators.<br/>Many animals supplement the protection afforded by their physiology by burrowing or otherwise adopting habitats or behaviors that insulate them from potential sources of harm.<br/>Additional structures like scales and hair offer further protection from the elements and from predators, with some animals having features such as spines or camouflage serving exclusively as anti-predator adaptations.<br/>Biological membranes such as bark on trees and skin on animals offer protection from various threats, with skin playing a key role in protecting organisms against pathogens and excessive water loss.<br/>Humans originally began wearing clothing and building shelters in prehistoric times for protection from the elements.<br/>In computer sciences the separation of protection and security is a design choice.<br/>Some kind of protection is a characteristic of all life, as living things have evolved at least some protective mechanisms to counter damaging environmental phenomena, such as ultraviolet light.<br/>The meaning of the word protection, as used in the electrical industry, is no different to that in everyday use.<br/>In the human sphere of activity, the concept of protection has been extended to nonliving objects, including technological systems such as computers, and to intangible things such as intellectual property, beliefs, and economic systems.<br/>The ratings for water ingress are not cumulative beyond IPX6.<br/><br/><strong>these animals</strong><strong>: </strong>Some animals are capable of asexual reproduction, which often results in a genetic clone of the parent.<br/>Several animals are microscopic.<br/>Most animals rely on the biomass and energy produced by plants through photosynthesis.<br/>A wide variety of terrestrial and aquatic animals are hunted for sport.<br/>Working animals including cattle and horses have been used for work and transport from the first days of agriculture.<br/>Several animal phyla lack bilateral symmetry.<br/>Marine fish of many species are caught commercially for food.<br/>Other animals may have very specific feeding behaviours, such as hawksbill sea turtles primarily eating sponges.<br/>Nearly all animals make use of some form of sexual reproduction.<br/>All animals are composed of cells, surrounded by a characteristic extracellular matrix composed of collagen and elastic glycoproteins.<br/><br/><strong>zoo</strong><strong>: </strong>Sometimes animals are unable to perform certain behaviors in zoos, like seasonal migration or traveling over large distances.<br/>The animals were moved to the London Zoo when it opened.<br/>Some behaviors are seen as essential for an animal's welfare whilst others aren't.<br/>A large number of animals are culled each year in zoos, but this is controversial.<br/>Zoo animals live in enclosures that often attempt to replicate their natural habitats or behavioral patterns, for the benefit of both the animals and visitors.<br/>Especially in large animals, a limited number of spaces are available in zoos.<br/>The animals may be trained to perform tricks, and visitors are able to get closer to them than in larger zoos.<br/>Nocturnal animals are often housed in buildings with a reversed light-dark cycle, i.<br/>Modern zoos also aim to help teach visitors the importance on animal conservation, often through letting visitors witness the animals firsthand.<br/>The welfare of zoo animals varies widely.<br/><br/><strong>lion</strong><strong>: </strong>Lions are not particularly known for their stamina.<br/>Lions are part of a group of exotic animals that have been central to zoo exhibits since the late 18th century.<br/>These deities were often connected with the sun god Ra and his fierce heat, and their dangerous power was invoked to guard people or sacred places.<br/>the animal's expressive movements are highly developed.<br/>The lion's repertoire of vocalisations is large.<br/>Another 11 animals thought to be Barbary lions kept in Addis Ababa Zoo are descendants of animals owned by Emperor Haile Selassie.<br/>Lion cubs are born blind.<br/>The lion is one of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture.<br/>In parts of West and East Africa, the lion is associated with healing and is regarded as the link between seers and the

for heating and lighting equipment from either of two main sources: directly from a head end power generator on the locomotive via bus cables, or by an axle-powered generator which continuously charges batteries whenever the train is in motion.<br/>Many multiple unit trains consist of cars which are semi-permanently coupled into sets: these sets may be joined together to form larger trains, but generally passengers can only move around between cars within a set.<br/>Such cars, when coupled together and hauled by one or more locomotives, form a train.<br/>Often, but not always, passenger cars in a train are linked together with enclosed, flexible gangway connections through which passengers and crewmen can walk.<br/>Long-distance trains often require baggage cars for the passengers' luggage.<br/><br/><strong>passenger</strong><strong>: </strong>Passenger car (rail), railway rolling stock for carrying passengers.<br/>Passenger car (Ferris wheel), a compartment for carrying

PepsiCo's primary competitors in the snack food market overall is Kraft Foods (now Mondelez International), which in the same year held 11 percent of the U.<br/>The Coca-Cola Company has historically been considered PepsiCo's primary competitor in the beverage market, and in December 2005, PepsiCo surpassed The Coca-Cola Company in market value for the first time in 12 years since both companies

that\u2014as a result of being selected in 2010\u2014received $250,000 towards construction of a fitness room.<br/>One of the American products exhibited was Pepsi Cola.<br/>The primary identifier of a food and beverage industry main brand is annual sales over $1 billion.<br/>In comparison, Coca-Cola is the fourth most popular carbonated drink, occupying a mere 8.<br/>His role in the advertisements is to appear with Pepsi to thirsty people or people craving soda.<br/>The theory has been advanced that New Coke, as the reformulated drink came to be known, was invented specifically in response to the Pepsi Challenge.<br/>once people's supply of bottle caps ran out, the only way they could get more was to buy more Pepsi.<br/><br/><strong>the drink</strong><strong>: </strong>A persistent problem in the soft drinks industry was the lack of an effective sealing of the bottles.<br/>Another early type of soft drink was lemonade, made of water and lemon juice sweetened with honey, but without carbonated water.<br/>The origins of soft drinks lie in the development of fruit-flavored drinks.<br/>The effect of coffee on human health has been a subject of many studies.<br/>The most popular varieties internationally are soy milk, almond milk, rice milk and coconut milk.<br/>Regarded as one of the \"original\" drinks, milk is the primary source of nutrition for babies.<br/>Some drinks, such as wine, can be used as an alternative investment.<br/>Of most importance is that the ingredient meets the agreed specification on all major parameters.<br/>One well-known example is the rum and coke, which may also contain lime juice.<br/>In other situations, the drinkware has practical application, such as coffee cups which are designed for insulation or brandy snifters which are designed to encourage evaporation but trap the aroma within the glass.<br/><br/><strong>plastic bottle</strong><strong>: </strong>The main difference between each type of water bottle is the flexibility of the material.<br/>The lowest impact water bottles are those made of glass or metal.<br/>However, the biggest advantage plastic bottles have over their glass counterparts is their superior resistance to breakage, in both production and transportation.<br/>An alternate benefit is minimizing storage, transportation, or disposal space when the bottle is empty or as the content is being dispersed, for example with water bottles used by hikers.<br/>The use of a water bottle allows an individual to drink and transport a beverage from one place to another.<br/>HDPE is the most widely used resin for plastic bottles.<br/>Inhalation of chemicals used in the manufacture of plastics is a hazard for the factory workers who handle the material.<br/>Except for wine and beer, the food industry has almost completely replaced glass bottles with plastic bottles.<br/>However, the popularity and availability of disposable plastic water bottles continues to rise.<br/>The materials used in the manufacture of plastic bottles vary by application.<br/><br/><strong>the main rival</strong><strong>: </strong>Shang Tsung is usually portrayed as the right-hand man of series archvillain Shao Kahn and the main rival and archenemy of Liu Kang.<br/>He is interested in simplicity in the recording and with the sound and vitality of real musicians in a room.<br/>The initial history of the character was explained in the 1992 Midway-produced comic book based on the original MK game, in which he was the first-ever Mortal Kombat (then the Shaolin Tournament) champion over 500 years ago from the date of the then-current tournament depicted in the actual game, yet he was stricken with a curse that forced him to consume the souls of his defeated opponents in order to keep his youth.<br/>The original idea was that Shang Tsung was a human traitor who had sold his soul.<br/>The union of Holiday, Buchanan, Everhart and Miley led to the formation of Rival Sons.<br/>Iron Shogun is eventually declared the tournament winner when he kills a pizza deliveryman who unwittingly enters the arena.<br/>Cobb encourages and captures the vocal punch of the band's mainman, Jay Buchanan.<br/>Shang Tsung plays his original role of the main antagonist in the first series of the Malibu Comics' Blood & Thunder miniseries, with his backstory mostly unchanged as an old man serving Shao Kahn to open the portal through 10 consecutive Mortal Kombat wins.<br/>Here's someone about to descend and doesn't know what they'll face, or where this might lead.<br/>Additionally, Shang Tsung is mentioned by name in several mirror-match introductions as a possible explanation as to why the characters fight themselves.<br/><br/><strong>blue wall</strong><strong>: </strong>One method of minimising the effects of the blue wall of silence is exposing those who follow it.<br/>There are also forces that work against the code and promote whistleblowing.<br/>Another reason officers may hesitate to go against the blue code may be that challenging the blue code would mean challenging long-standing traditions and feelings of brotherhood within the institution.<br/>Many states have taken measures in police academies to promote the exposure of the blue code.<br/>The low number of officers coming forward may have to do with the understanding that things happen in the heat of the moment that some officers would rather keep personal.<br/>Several campaigns against the blue code of silence or for making it more visible in the public eye have taken place in the United States.<br/>\"  The earliest description of the forces creating the blue wall comes from a Houston Chronicle blogger, Chris Ladd.<br/>Trump's lone breakthrough in the \"blue wall\" in 2020 was the one electoral vote from Maine, which he again won.<br/>The police department is only responsible for preventing corruption among officers.<br/>Some words used to describe these values are as follows: a sense of mission, action, cynicism, pessimism, machismo, suspicion, conservatism, isolation and solidarity.<br/><br/><strong>wine</strong><strong>: </strong>The main active ingredient of wine is alcohol, and therefore, the health effects of alcohol apply to wine.<br/>The main corporate sponsor of Wine is CodeWeavers, which employs Julliard and many other Wine developers to work on Wine and on CrossOver, CodeWeavers' supported version of Wine.<br/>Later, the descendants of the sacramental wine were refined for a more palatable taste.<br/>In fine restaurants in Western countries, wine typically accompanies dinner.<br/>Alcoholic drinks, including wine, are forbidden under most interpretations of Islamic law.<br/>An alternative for installing Internet Explorer directly is to use the now-defunct IEs4Linux.<br/>The most common wines purchased for investment include those from Bordeaux and Burgundy.<br/>As long as the primary substance fermented is honey, the drink is considered mead.<br/>The use of wine in ancient Near Eastern and Ancient Egyptian religious ceremonies was common.<br/>Some people are drawn to canned wine due to its portability and recyclable packaging.<br/><br/><strong>juice</strong><strong>: </strong>One of the first regularly produced juices was lemonade, appearing in 16th-century Italy, as an import, after its conception in the Middle East.<br/>\"No added sugar\" is commonly printed on labels of juice containers, but the products may contain large amounts of naturally occurring sugars.<br/>The largest fruit juice consumers are New Zealand (nearly a cup, or 8 ounces, each day) and Colombia (more than three quarters of a cup each day).<br/>High intensity pulsed electric fields are being used as an alternative to heat pasteurization in fruit juices.<br/>Processing time of the juice is calculated by multiplying the number of pulses with the effective pulse duration.<br/>In Mexico, juice bars have become more popular in the 2000s.<br/>The term \"juice drink\" is not defined in the Regulations and can be used to describe any drink which includes juice, whatever the amount.<br/>5 percent, and set taxes on fruit juices based on the alcohol content of the drink.<br/>In addition, the use of PEF results in minimal detrimental effects on the quality of the food.<br/>According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the term \"nectar\" is generally accepted in the US and in international trade for a diluted juice to denote a beverage that contains fruit juice or puree, water, and artificial sweeteners.<br/><br/><strong>face</strong><strong>: </strong>The bones involved in shaping the face are mainly the maxilla, mandible, nasal bone and zygomatic bone.<br/>The face is a part of the body, the front of the head.<br/>Facial shape is an important determinant of beauty, particularly facial symmetry.<br/>The shape of the face is influenced by the bone-structure of the skull, and each face is unique through the anatomical variation present in the bones of the viscerocranium (and neurocranium).<br/>By extension, anything which is the forward or world-facing part of a system which has internal structure is considered its \"face\", like the fa\u00e7ade of a building.<br/>The muscles of the face play a prominent role in the expression of emotion, and vary among different individuals, giving rise to additional diversity in expression and facial features.<br/>The pattern of specific organs, such as the eyes, or of parts of them, is used in biometric identification to uniquely identify individuals.<br/>The front of the human head is called the face.<br/>The face is the feature which best distinguishes a person.<br/>For example, a public relations or press officer might be called the \"face\" of the organization he or she represents.<br/><br/><strong>milk</strong><strong>: </strong>The most durable form of milk is powdered milk, which is produced from milk by removing almost all water.<br/>Another significant and popular addition to the marketplace has been flavored milks.<br/>Sweetened milk is a drink popular with students of all ages and is often sold in small plastic bags complete with straw.<br/>A significant addition to the marketplace has been \"long-life\" milk (UHT), generally available in 1 and 2 liter rectangular cardboard cartons.<br/>Two of the main reasons for the decline of UK home deliveries by milkmen are household refrigerators (which lessen the need for daily milk deliveries) and private car usage (which has increased supermarket shopping).<br/>The largest structures in the fluid portion of the milk are \"casein micelles\": aggregates of several thousand protein molecules with superficial resemblance to a surfactant micelle, bonded with the help of nanometer-scale particles of calcium phosphate.<br/>The standard unit of measuring milk quantity in Kenya is a liter.<br/>The most common flavors, besides the natural presentation, are chocolate, strawberry and vanilla.<br/>As seen in China, sweetened and flavored milk drinks are commonly seen in vending machines.<br/>A side effect of the heating of pasteurization is that some vitamin and mineral content is lost.<br/><br/><strong>hand</strong><strong>: </strong>The primary function of the extensors is to straighten out the digits.<br/>A common fracture of the hand is a scaphoid fracture\u2014a fracture of the scaphoid bone, one of the carpal bones.<br/>A reliable way of identifying human hands is from the presence of opposable thumbs.<br/>The thumb is undoubtedly the \"master digit\" of the hand, giving value to all the other fingers.<br/>The neural machinery underlying hand movements is a major contributing factor.<br/>There are several cutaneous conditions that can affect the hand including the nails.<br/>Another common fracture, known as Boxer's fracture, is to the neck of a metacarpal.<br/>The recent evolution of the human hand is thus a direct result of the development of the central nervous system, and the hand, therefore, is a direct tool of our consciousness \u2014 the main source of differentiated tactile sensations \u2014 and a precise working organ enabling gestures \u2014 the expressions of our personalities.<br/>The muscles acting on the hand can be subdivided into two groups: the extrinsic and intrinsic muscle groups.<br/>The web of the hand is a \"fold of skin which connects the digits\".<br/><br/><strong>table</strong><strong>: </strong>The relationship of the f-block to the other blocks of the periodic table also becomes easier to see.<br/>The chemistries of the two categories of metals resemble one another to a large degree.<br/>A common alternative is at the top of group 17 given hydrogen's strictly univalent and largely non-metallic chemistry, and the strictly univalent and non-metallic chemistry of fluorine (the element otherwise at the top of group 17).<br/>The position of hydrogen in group 1 is reasonably well settled.<br/>they behave as if they were located on the left side of the table.<br/>The property that distinguishes helium from the rest of the noble gases is that in its closed electron shell, helium has only two electrons in the outermost electron orbital, while the rest of the noble gases have eight.<br/>A majority of nonmetals are colored or colorless insulating gases.<br/>Another consequence is the increased metallicity of the following elements in a block after the first kainosymmetric orbital, along with a preference for higher oxidation states.<br/>The bifurcation of group 3 is a throwback to the Mendeleev eight column-form in which seven of the main groups each have two subgroups.<br/>The recognition and acceptance afforded to Mendeleev's table came from two decisions he made.<br/><br/><strong>man</strong><strong>: </strong>Another significant hormone in sexual differentiation is the anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone, which inhibits the development of the M\u00fcllerian ducts.<br/>The actual determining factor is the SRY gene, which is normally found on the Y chromosome.<br/>This difference in the relative amounts of these sex steroids is largely responsible for the physiological differences that distinguish men from women.<br/>In all cultures in the past, and still among traditional and non-Western cultures, getting married is the most common and definitive distinction between boyhood and manhood.<br/>This difference in the relative amounts of these sex steroids is responsible for the physiological differences that distinguish men from women.<br/>The male reproductive system's function is to produce semen, which carries sperm and thus genetic information that can unite with an egg within a woman.<br/>Most expressions of sexual dimorphism in humans are found in height, weight, and body structure, though there are always examples that do not follow the overall pattern.<br/>In mammals, the hormones that influence sexual differentiation and development are androgens (mainly testosterone), which stimulate later development of the ovary.<br/>In Western culture, for example, greater masculinity usually brings greater social status.<br/>In human beings, the sex of an individual is determined at the time of fertilization by the genetic material carried in the sperm cell.<br/><br/><strong>tea</strong><strong>: </strong>The popular green tea called kahwah is often served after every meal in the Pashtun belt of Balochistan and in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.<br/>One form of Chinese tea ceremony is the Gongfu tea ceremony, which typically uses small Yixing clay teapots and oolong tea.<br/>But, unquestionably, the feature of Compo rations destined to be remembered beyond all others is Compo tea.<br/>The order of steps in preparing a cup of tea is a much-debated topic and can vary widely between cultures or even individuals.<br/>Examples of additions added at the point of consumption include milk, sugar and lemon.<br/>It is the most common beverage of households in the region.<br/>It is customary for a host to offer tea to guests soon after their arrival.<br/>There are many different types of tea.<br/>The addition of milk to tea in Europe was first mentioned in 1680 by the epistolist Madame de S\u00e9vign\u00e9.<br/>Compressed tea was the most popular form of tea in China during the Tang dynasty.<br/><br/><strong>raising cane's chicken fingers</strong><strong>: </strong>The chain first began expanding internationally in 2015, opening its first restaurant in Kuwait.<br/>The namesake mascot is not seen on signage and merchandise, as dogs are not popular in Kuwait.<br/>The current dog is Raising Cane III, adopted in January 2018.<br/>Raising Cane's offers a limited menu consisting of five main combos: the \"Box Combo,\" the \"3 Finger Combo,\" the \"Caniac Combo,\" the \"Kids Combo,\" and the \"Sandwich Combo.<br/>The business plan was rejected numerous times by potential investors, so Graves earned the needed money  working as a boilermaker in a Los Angeles refinery and fishing for sockeye salmon in Alaska.<br/>The two couldn't persuade bankers to fund the restaurant idea, so Graves worked at a refinery and then joined Silvey as a salmon fisherman to raise the money to open the first restaurant, which opened right outside the north gates of Louisiana State University on Highland Road in 1996.<br/>He and Silvey obtained a SBA loan which they used to open the first restaurant in Baton Rouge.<br/>While employed at Guthrie's, Graves's boss was Roddy Smith.<br/>The project received a C- in the class, and the professor commented that a chicken-fingers-only business could never succeed.<br/>The restaurants are named after Graves' dog.<br/><br/><strong>coffee</strong><strong>: </strong>The best (but least used) method of drying coffee is using drying tables.<br/>The next step in the process is the roasting of the green coffee.<br/>The roasting process influences the taste of the beverage by changing the coffee bean both physically and chemically.<br/>The traditional method of planting coffee is to place 20 seeds in each hole at the beginning of the rainy season.<br/>A contemporary example of religious prohibition of coffee can be found in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.<br/>Paralleling (and complementing) the rapid rise of instant coffee was the coffee vending machine invented in 1947 and widely distributed since the 1950s.<br/>The tendency of coffee to absorb strong smells from food means that it should be kept away from such smells.<br/>The organization regards the consumption of coffee as both physically and spiritually unhealthy.<br/>The caffeine content of a cup of coffee varies depending mainly on the brewing method, and also on the coffee variety.<br/>Bottled coffee drinks are also consumed in the United States.<br/><br/><strong>the table</strong><strong>: </strong>The relationship of the f-block to the other blocks of the

performance due to their similar goal scoring record.<br/>White's first goal for the club was against her former club Birmingham City in the League Cup.<br/>White was personally recognised for her form over 2011, being voted the England Women's Player of the Year.<br/>The ratio of the size of the optic cup to the optic disc (cup-to-disc ratio, or C/D) is one measure used in the diagnosis of glaucoma.<br/>White scored twice in the 2018 SheBelieves Cup, both coming in England's match against Germany.<br/>She was also part of the Great Britain team for the 2012 Summer Olympics.<br/>The optic cup is the white, cup-like area in the center of the optic disc.<br/>The game attracted a record crowd for a Lioness's game of 77,768.<br/>White was joint top scorer in the competition which saw England finish second.<br/>White comes from a family of West Ham United supporters who, alongside her husband, regularly attend international fixtures.<br/><br/>", "concept":

windshields were made of ordinary window glass, but that could lead to serious injuries in the event of a crash.<br/>The urethane sealant is protected from UV in sunlight by a band of dark dots called a frit around the edge of the windshield.<br/>Aircraft windshields are designed in such a way that even if a crack were to extend all the way across the panel, the structural integrity is maintained via multiple failsafe methods in both frame and the glass plies.<br/>on inside of the windshield.<br/>Aero screens are usually less than 20 cm (8 inches) in height.<br/>If a crack extends to the edge of the panel then this would compromise the structural integrity of the windshield.<br/>Modern windshields are generally made of laminated safety glass, a type of treated glass, which consists of, typically, two curved sheets of glass with a plastic layer laminated between them for safety, and bonded into the window frame.<br/>The hardened glass shattered into many mostly harmless fragments

poles.<br/>The principal production centres in the UK are in Kent (which produces Kent Goldings hops), Herefordshire, and Worcestershire.<br/>The degree of bitterness imparted by hops depends on the degree to which alpha acids are isomerized during the boil, and the impact of a given amount of hops is specified in International Bitterness Units.<br/>Hop plants are planted in rows about 2 to 2.<br/>The cones grow high on the bine, and in the past, these cones were picked by hand.<br/>Gruit was used when the nobility levied taxes on hops.<br/>The hop plant's reproduction method is that

rare is because the monster is more likely to attack the one who is trying to do the killing.<br/>However, these games tended to be unfriendly to more casual players.<br/>Often a player will have to lure the monster towards the other player and run away, so that the monster (if it is aggressive) will look for a new target, which may be the other player.<br/>In most cases, there are vast differences in abilities between experienced and novice players.<br/>A rarer form of player killing involves inciting a monster or monsters to attack another player.<br/>Through various means, \"flags\" can be turned on or off, allowing PvP combat with other people who have also turned on their flag.<br/>In some games a character will die many times and the player must often sacrifice some experience points (XP) or in-game currency to restore that character to life.<br/>An example of such a mode is Hardcore mode on the game Diablo II.<br/>PvP can even encourage experienced players to immediately attack and kill inexperienced players.<br/>This behavior is often found in otherwise purely 'PVE' games such as Realm of the Mad God.<br/><br/><strong>batter</strong><strong>: </strong>The purpose of using beer is so the bubbles in the beer will add body and lightness to the batter.<br/>Depending on the type and quality of the beer, beer may also add colour or some flavour to the batter.<br/>Some foods that are commonly beer battered and fried are fish, chips, and onion rings.<br/>The ideal batter for fried foods is to be thick enough to adhere to the food, but not so thick as to become heavy.<br/>The practice of beer battering is popular in Australia, New Zealand, the United States, Britain, Ireland, Germany, Iceland and Russia.<br/>One reason is that a basic batter can be made from merely flour, beer, and some salt.<br/>Many other flavourings such as herbs, spices, fruits or vegetables may be added to the mixture.<br/>Batter is most often used for pancakes, light cakes, and as a coating for fried foods.<br/>Batter (baseball), person whose turn it is to face the pitcher.<br/>Other substitutes for water are wine, or flavored liquors like curacao, brandy, and maraschino.<br/><br/><strong>homerun</strong><strong>: </strong>The next batter, veteran backstop Toby Hall, tried aimlessly to hit the ball as far as possible, but his effort resulted in a strike out.<br/>Sometimes the next batter will be expecting that and will capitalize on it.<br/>If a pitcher gives up a homer, he might have his concentration broken and might alter his normal approach in an attempt to \"make up for it\" by striking out the next batter with some fastballs.<br/>Simple back-to-back home runs are a relatively frequent occurrence.<br/>The term \"four-run homer\" is seldom used.<br/>Unlike with an outside-the-park home run, the batter-runner and all preceding runners are liable to be put out by the defensive team at any time while running the bases.<br/>Therefore, inside-the-park home runs are now rare.<br/>Then he hit his three home runs on the first pitch of his next three at bats, off of three different pitchers (4th inning- Hooten, 5th inning- Sosa, 8th inning- Hough).<br/>In both occurrences, his homer was the second of the four.<br/>This can only happen if the ball does not leave the ballfield.<br/><br/><strong>the next thing</strong><strong>: </strong>The next right thing is looking at your calendar and going to work.<br/>The next right thing is brushing your teeth.<br/>The next right thing is eating your breakfast.<br/>What do I do when I don't want to get out of bed in the morning? You just do the next right thing, and that's stepping out of bed.<br/>A lot of people feel that feeling: What do I do when I don't know what to do? My personal mantra is you just do the next right thing.<br/>Later in the song, she concludes when not knowing to do, one must do \"The Next Right Thing\".<br/>At the darkest moment of the film, Anna is faced with uncertainty about what to do next after apparently losing both her beloved sister Elsa as well as Olaf, a snowman created by Elsa's magic.<br/>She sings \"The Next Right Thing\" and expresses her depression.<br/>The song is about Anna's descent into depression.<br/>I really wanted Anna to be representative of that.<br/><br/><strong>hit ball</strong><strong>: </strong>the next time each player rotates will be after the other team wins possession of the ball and loses the point.<br/>When a bowler bowls a no-ball, the immediate next ball is a free hit.<br/>when the only player on the server's team to touch the ball is the server.<br/>In this situation, the player makes use of a specific rolling technique to minimize the chances of injuries.<br/>in this case the umpire is required to signal the free hit again.<br/>Sometimes a player may also be forced to drop their body quickly to the floor to save the ball.<br/>Ideally, the contact with the ball is made at the apex of the hitter's jump.<br/>When one player is ready to serve, some teams will line up their other five players in a screen to obscure the view of the receiving team.<br/>The big advantage of this system is that the setter always has 3 hitters to vary sets with.<br/>The attack, also known as the spike, is usually the third contact a team makes with the ball.<br/><br/><strong>swing</strong><strong>: </strong>Baseball swing, the process of attempting to hit a ball with a bat in the game of baseball.<br/>Swing, an understudy in the musical theatre who

not necessarily mean that most people won't agree on which notes are higher and lower.<br/>Complex and aperiodic sound waves can often be assigned a pitch by this method.<br/>The jnd is typically tested by playing two tones in quick succession with the listener asked if there was a difference in their pitches.<br/>The pitch of complex tones can be ambiguous, meaning that two or more different pitches can be perceived, depending upon the observer.<br/>As a result, musicians need a way to refer to a particular pitch in an unambiguous manner when talking to each other.<br/>The jnd becomes smaller if the two tones are played simultaneously as the listener is then able to discern beat frequencies.<br/>The system is flexible enough to include \"microtones\" not found on standard piano keyboards.<br/>Not all musical instruments make notes with a clear pitch.<br/>A sound generated on any instrument produces many modes of vibration that occur simultaneously.<br/>It is still possible for two sounds of indefinite pitch to clearly be higher or lower than one another.<br/><br/><strong>this player</strong><strong>: </strong>The reason this is rare is because the monster is more likely

promotional activities had already begun.<br/>The guitar sound is heavily distorted and dissonant, with choruses that often involve guitar feedback waves.<br/>Later, after recording and touring in

Danny Manners (keyboards, double bass), who was now an official member of the band.<br/>The response to the album was very positive, culminating in a licensing deal in Japan where the CD was re-released in 1995, with a bonus track.<br/>The lineup of the band during the recording Bard consisted of Spawton, Poole, Read, M\u00fcller, the returning Cooper, and drummer Phil Hogg.<br/>Eventually, Tony M\u00fcller was recruited as keyboard player in early 1995 during the recording of the new album.<br/>The original artwork was also replaced with new images by Jim Trainer

is a better way to improve energy levels and advance mood than using a treadmill at the gym.<br/>The term jog was often used in English and North American literature to describe short quick movements, either intentional or unintentional.<br/>its definition, as compared with running, is not standard.<br/>Jogging is useful for fighting obesity and staying healthy.<br/>It is suggested by the American Cancer Society that jogging for at least 30 minutes five days a week can help in cancer prevention.<br/>The main intention is to increase physical fitness with less stress on the body than from faster running but more than walking, or to maintain a steady speed for longer periods of time.<br/>According to a study by Stanford University School of Medicine, jogging is effective in increasing human lifespan, and decreasing the effects of aging, with benefits for the cardiovascular system.<br/><br/><strong>medium</strong><strong>: </strong>As Baba tries to see where the noise came from and

</strong>The manufacture of T-shirts has become highly automated and may include cutting fabric with a laser or a water jet.<br/>A T-shirt typically extends to the waist.<br/>First, the one-piece

the camera as if embarrassed.<br/>he has lost all the buttons on his undershirt and has safety-pinned its flaps together.<br/>A 1990s trend in women's clothing involved tight-fitting cropped T-shirt or crop tops short enough to reveal the midriff.<br/>A shirt can also be worn with a necktie under the shirt collar.<br/>The most common form of commercial T-shirt decoration is screen printing.<br/>The party leaders of Dravidar Kazhagam in India wear only black shirts to symbolise atheism.<br/>Designer Katharine Hamnett, in the early 1980s, pioneered outsize T-shirts with large-print slogans.<br/><br/><strong>the waist size</strong><strong>: </strong>It appears that men in westernized societies are more influenced by female waist size than hip size:.<br/>The methods include the use of a corset to reduce the waist size and hip and buttock padding to increase the apparent size of the hips and buttocks.<br/>\"Blind men prefer a low waist-to-hip ratio\".<br/>It was predicted that the effect of breast size on judgment of attractiveness and age estimation would be dependent on overall body fat and the size of the waist-to-hip ratio.<br/>The three sizes are used mostly in fashion, and almost exclusively in reference to women, who, compared to men, are more likely to have a narrow waist relative to bust and hips.<br/>An important difference exists when measuring men's hips for most fashion design purposes.<br/>For example, a person with a 30\u2033 (76 cm) waist and 38\u2033 (97 cm) hips has a waist-hip ratio of about 0.<br/>the normal range of female WHR was often higher than in western cultures,.<br/>In these instances, men's hips are measured at the genitals.<br/>When ratings of the figures' attractiveness were made, generally it appeared that bust size, WHR, and their weight were all important contributory elements.<br/><br/><strong>the man</strong><strong>: </strong>For example, men tend to be taller than women, but there are many people of both sexes who are in the mid-height range for the species.<br/>This difference in the relative amounts of these sex steroids is largely responsible for the physiological differences that distinguish men from women.<br/>This difference in the relative amounts of these sex steroids is responsible for the physiological differences that distinguish men from women.<br/>In human beings, the

other law enforcement or penal authorities.<br/>The film Undercover Brother had as a plot element a fictional organization headed by \"The Man\", an actual man in charge of oppressing African Americans.<br/>While the majority of men are heterosexual, significant minorities are homosexual or bisexual.<br/>Most expressions of sexual dimorphism in humans are found in height, weight, and body structure, though there are always examples that do not follow the overall pattern.<br/><br/><strong>large</strong><strong>: </strong>Larger sieve, a heightening of the large sieve.<br/>The form of municipal election is widespread in small towns to avoid \"them and us\" cultural dissociation of dividing them into wards.<br/>The town of Islip, New York was sued by four residents in 2018 for violating the Voting Rights Act by maintaining a discriminatory at-large council system.<br/>The solution adopted by Cambridge, Massachusetts is to hold ranked-choice voting for all seats.<br/>Due to at-large voting, African Americans had been unable to elect any candidate of their choice to either of these boards for decades.<br/>It follows each such true or quasi-local government unit does not in the purest sense elect members at-large when analysing their geography as each member co-exists with the others who have territorial overlap, as representing greater or lower-rank districts.<br/>One-third of Islip's population is Hispanic, but only one person of color has ever been elected to a town seat.<br/>Large means of great size.<br/>In the late 1980s, several major cities in Tennessee reached settlement in court cases to adopt single-member districts in order to enable minorities to elect candidates of their choice to city councils.<br/>\u00a7 2c, dictates that representatives must be elected from geographical districts and that these must be single-member districts.<br/><br/><strong>the black shorts</strong><strong>: </strong>The trouble with you, Spode, is that just because you have succeeded in inducing a handful of half-wits to disfigure the London scene by going about in black shorts, you think you're someone.<br/>Many urban school portraits from the 1890s show all but the oldest boys wearing knee pants.<br/>Because of this, men would not wear shorts to avoid looking immature.<br/>At some point, he leaves the Black Shorts.<br/>The Black Shorts are portrayed as a tiny group of around a dozen men and teenage boys dressed in uniforms like those of the Sturmabteilung.<br/>When Bertie Wooster rebukes Spode in The Code of the Woosters (1938), he mocks Spode's black shorts, calling them \"footer bags\" (football shorts):.<br/>While the leader of the Black Shorts, he is also secretly a designer of ladies' underclothing, being the proprietor of Eulalie Soeurs of Bond Street.<br/>Spode is a large and intimidating figure, with a powerful, square face.<br/>In some countries adult women can be seen wearing loose-fitting shorts that end at or just below the knee, as these are seen as sufficiently modest.<br/>By the late 20th century however it became common for men to wear shorts as casual wear in summer.<br/><br/><strong>man</strong><strong>: </strong>For example, men tend to be taller than women, but there are many people of both sexes who are in the mid-height range for the species.<br/>This

passed, some fraction of the deformation will be permanent and non-reversible and is known as plastic deformation.<br/>To move this defect (plastically deforming or yielding the material), a larger stress must be applied.<br/>When a metal is subjected to large plastic deformations the grain sizes and orientations change in the direction of deformation.<br/>However, for critical situations, tension testing is done to eliminate ambiguity.<br/>Engineering metals display strain hardening, which implies that the yield stress is increased after unloading from a yield state.<br/>If a metal is only stressed to the upper yield point, and beyond, L\u00fcders bands can develop.<br/>High strength steel and aluminum alloys do not exhibit a yield point, so this offset yield point is used on these materials.<br/>Below the yield point, a material will deform elastically and will return to its original shape when the applied stress is removed.<br/>In some materials, such as aluminium, there is a gradual onset of non-linear behavior, making the precise yield point difficult to determine.<br/>Where a buildup of dislocations at a grain boundary causes a repulsive force between dislocations.<br/><br/><strong>enter</strong><strong>: </strong>At the end of the first day, Han gives strict orders to the competitors not to leave their rooms.<br/>It is also the most savagely

bought a Ferrari of his own from  Michael Jordan.<br/>These desks are not as tall as normal adult desks.<br/>With computers more prevalent, \"computer paper\" became an office supply.<br/>Thus, age alone does not guarantee that an antique desk is a masterpiece, since this split in quality took place more than a hundred years ago.<br/>It often is a pedestal desk, with only one of the two

social psychology, marketing, and public relations, a public has a more situational definition.<br/>mass, where a public is simply viewed as a population of individuals.<br/>In the United States, determining whether a work has entered the public domain or is still under copyright can be quite complex, primarily because copyright terms have been extended multiple times and in different ways\u2014shifting over the course of the 20th century from a fixed-term based on first publication, with a possible renewal term, to a term extending to 50, then 70, years after the death of the author.<br/>The museum claimed that the photos were taken by their staff, and that photography within the museum by visitors was prohibited.<br/>However, the usage of the term public domain can be more granular, including for example uses of works in copyright permitted by copyright exceptions.<br/>So, in this perspective, the public is still a fundamental notion to social life although in a different manner in comparison to 18th century Public Sphere's Public.<br/>Therefore, photos taken by the museum, even of material that itself had fallen into the public domain, were protected by copyright law and would need to be removed from the Wikimedia image repository.<br/>According to James Boyle this definition underlines common usage of the term public domain and equates the public domain to public property and works in copyright to private property.<br/>The Unlicense, published around 2010, has a focus on an anti-copyright message.<br/>For example, the drug acetylsalicylic acid

whether the home is mobile or stationary.<br/>however, it was later clarified that a tiny house may not be on wheels but must be secured to a foundation.<br/>In understanding these considerations, it is important to note that not everyone is suited for a tiny house.<br/>Increasingly, tiny houses have become larger, heavier, and more expensive.<br/>The long-term viability of tiny houses for

local fishing industries because of the loss of life, and communities living close to the water's edge.<br/>Weathering and river deposition also accelerate the process of creating a beach, along with marine animals interacting with rocks, such as eating the algae off of them.<br/>When sand is taken out of the water it increases the risk of landslides, which can lead to loss of agricultural land

tropical lakes never reaches the temperature of maximum density, there is no process that makes the water mix.<br/>In the daytime a lake can cool the land beside it with local winds, resulting in a sea breeze.<br/>In very shallow water bodies, iron oxides make water reddish brown.<br/>Therefore, lake organisms can often be studied in isolation from the lake's surroundings.<br/>However, this typical stratification sequence can vary widely depending either on the specific lake, the time of season, or combination of both.<br/>of dissolved and suspended material in a lake.<br/><br/><strong>green umbrella</strong><strong>: </strong>Larger parasols capable of blocking the sun for several people are often used as fixed or semi-fixed devices, used with patio tables or other outdoor furniture, or as points of shade on a sunny beach.<br/>The umbrella served in this case as a defense against rain rather than sun.<br/>In the ceremonies of Timkat (Epiphany), priests will carry a model of the Tablets of Stone, called a Tabot, on their heads in procession to a body of water, which will then be blessed.<br/>Hence, a parasol shields from sunlight while a parapluie shields from rain.<br/>In some paintings on a temple wall, a parasol is held over the figure of a god carried in procession.<br/>Another distinction can be made between manually operated umbrellas and spring-loaded automatic umbrellas, which spring open at the press of a button.<br/>It is designed to protect a person against rain or sunlight.<br/>When used for snow, it's called a paraneige.<br/>some parasols are not waterproof.<br/>Umbrella canopies may be made of fabric or flexible plastic.<br/><br/><strong>fresh</strong><strong>: </strong>Some organisms can thrive on salt water, but the great majority of higher plants and most mammals need fresh water to live.<br/>01% of it as surface water in lakes, swamps and rivers.<br/>Some can use salt water but many organisms including the great majority of higher plants and most mammals must have access to fresh water to live.<br/>Though the term specifically excludes seawater and brackish water, it does include mineral-rich waters such as chalybeate springs.<br/>75% is fresh water, including 1.<br/>Although most aquatic organisms have a limited ability to regulate their osmotic balance and therefore can only live within a narrow range of salinity, diadromous fish have the ability to migrate between fresh water and saline water bodies.<br/>Similarly the marine iguanas on the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands excrete excess salt through a nasal gland and they sneeze out a very salty excretion.<br/>It may also be in direct contact with the underlying underground water.<br/>Fresh water habitats are classified as either lentic systems, which are the stillwaters including ponds, lakes, swamps and mires.<br/>The majority of fresh water on Earth is in ice caps.<br/><br/><strong>salt water beach</strong><strong>: </strong>Evergreen's main campus, which includes its own salt-water beach, spans 1,000 acres of forest close to the southern end of the Puget Sound.<br/>One relates to an assistant who substituted fresh water with sea water\u2014either through laziness or accident.<br/>Students use the beach and tidelands for scientific study and as a place to get away from their studies and relax.<br/>Although it is called \"salt water\" taffy, it does not include any seawater but does contain both salt and water in its manufacture.<br/>There are multiple trails leading to the beach and a small road that leads to the only building at the beach and a small boat ramp.<br/>Despite its name, the taffy contains no salt water (seawater), but does contain both salt and water.<br/>Another cites a storm which caused ocean water to wash over the candy, which was consequently (and successfully) marketed with the appropriate name.<br/>Salt water taffy is still sold widely on the boardwalks in Atlantic City (including shops in existence since the 19th century), nearby Ocean City, and other popular beaches throughout the United States like Cape Cod.<br/>Caramel candies are sometimes referred to as taffy (taffy apples), but are very different from common salt water taffy.<br/>0 km) of untouched beach and 27 acres (11 ha) of southern Puget Sound tidelands.<br/><br/><strong>pacific ocean</strong><strong>: </strong>Marine debris, also known as marine litter, is human-created waste that has ended up floating in a lake, sea, ocean, or waterway.<br/>Some of these islands are structurally associated with nearby continents.<br/>The volume of the Pacific Ocean, representing about 50.<br/>Biggest seas in Pacific Ocean.<br/>however, each particular basin has its own seasonal patterns.<br/>The lowest counts of less than 32 parts per thousand are found in the far north as less evaporation of seawater takes place in these frigid areas.<br/>In the 16th and 17th centuries, Spain considered the Pacific Ocean a mare clausum\u2014a sea closed to other naval powers.<br/>The Pacific Ocean is the only ocean which is mostly bounded by subduction zones.<br/>Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter.<br/>The exploitation of the Pacific's mineral wealth is hampered by the ocean's great depths.<br/><br/><strong>small wave</strong><strong>: </strong>Ripples on the surface of a pond are actually a combination of transverse and longitudinal waves.<br/>A ripple on a pond is one example.<br/>Sometimes one is interested in a single specific wave.<br/>The analysis of the wave can be based upon comparison of the local wavelength with the local water depth.<br/>For example, in an ocean wave approaching shore, the incoming wave undulates with a varying local wavelength that depends in part on the depth of the sea floor compared to the wave height.<br/>The image depicts an enormous wave threatening three boats off the coast in the Sagami Bay (Kanagawa Prefecture) while Mount Fuji rises in the background.<br/>As the name of the piece indicates the boats are in Kanagawa prefecture, with Tokyo to the north, Mount Fuji to the northwest, the bay of Sagami to the south and the bay of Tokyo to the east.<br/>Apple macOS and iOS display a small version of the Great Wave as the image for the Water Wave emoji.<br/>Gaussian wave packets also are used to analyze water waves.<br/>This is the case, for example, when studying vibrations in a violin string or recorder.<br/><br/><strong>salt</strong><strong>: </strong>Elsewhere, salt is extracted from the vast sedimentary deposits which have been laid down over the millennia from the evaporation of seas and lakes.<br/>Salt evaporation ponds are filled from the ocean and salt crystals can be harvested as the water dries up.<br/>A dish of salt and a dish of water are almost always present on an altar, and salt is used in a wide variety of rituals and ceremonies.<br/>Sometimes these ponds have vivid colours, as some species of algae and other micro-organisms thrive in conditions of high salinity.<br/>One of the largest salt mining operations in the world is at the Khewra Salt Mine in Pakistan.<br/>A major source of salt is seawater, which has a salinity of approximately 3.<br/>In Aztec mythology, Huixtocihuatl was a fertility goddess who presided over salt and salt water.<br/>Salt is processed from salt mines, and by the evaporation of seawater (sea salt) and mineral-rich spring water in shallow pools.<br/>as of the author's writing in 1958, sea salt was still the currency best appreciated in the interior.<br/>These are either mined directly, producing rock salt, or are extracted in solution by pumping water into the deposit.<br/><br/><strong>tide</strong><strong>: </strong>The timing is relative to high water at some harbour where the tidal behaviour is similar in pattern, though it may be far away.<br/>About 98% of this dissipation is by marine tidal movement.<br/>The broadest classifications are based on substrates \u2014 rocky shore or soft bottom.<br/>Tidal energy can be extracted by two means: inserting a water turbine into a tidal current, or building ponds that release/admit water through a turbine.<br/>In addition to oceanic tides, large lakes can experience small tides and even planets can experience atmospheric tides and Earth tides.<br/>To make accurate records, tide gauges at fixed stations measure water level over time.<br/>The influence of the Moon on bodies of water was also mentioned in Ptolemy's Tetrabiblos.<br/>Also, although a water channel's center is the most useful measuring site, mariners object when current-measuring equipment obstructs waterways.<br/>Instead, the flow direction and magnitude trace an ellipse over a tidal cycle (on a polar plot) instead of along the ebb and flood lines.<br/>To calculate the actual water depth, add the charted depth to the published tide height.<br/><br/><strong>a salt water beach</strong><strong>: </strong>One relates to an assistant who substituted fresh water with sea water\u2014either through laziness or accident.<br/>In the southern portion of the lake, where the vast majority of the fresh water inlets are found, the salt level can dip below what is necessary for the brine shrimp to survive.<br/>Since the Great Salt Lake is a shallow lake with gently sloping shores around all edges except on the south side, small variations in the water level greatly affect the extent of the shoreline.<br/>state of Utah, is the largest salt water lake in the Western Hemisphere, and the eighth-largest terminal lake in the world.<br/>In the two bays that receive most of the lake's fresh water inflows, Bear River Bay and Farmington Bay, the diversity of organisms is much higher.<br/>However, the fresh- and salt-water wetlands along the eastern and northern edges of the Great Salt Lake provide critical habitat for millions of migratory shorebirds and waterfowl in western North America.<br/>Solar evaporation ponds at the edges of the lake produce salts and brine (water with high salt quantity).<br/>Although it is called \"salt water\" taffy, it does not include any seawater but does contain both salt and water in its manufacture.<br/>It has been stated that this does not pose a risk to other recreational users of the lake.<br/>Populations of brine shrimp are mostly restricted to the lake's south arm.<br/><br/>", "concept": "<strong>salt

having only two pectoral nipples, a pendulous penis, and a lack of sensory whiskers.<br/>Although both the New and Old World monkeys, like the apes, have forward-facing eyes, the faces of Old World and New World monkeys look very different, though again, each group shares some features such as the types of noses, cheeks and rumps.<br/>most New World monkeys have prehensile tails while Old World monkeys have non-prehensile tails or no visible tail at all.<br/>Some characteristics are shared among the groups.<br/>They are used primarily because of their relative ease of handling, their fast reproductive cycle (compared to apes) and their psychological and physical similarity to humans.<br/>In Buddhism, the monkey is an early incarnation of Buddha but may also represent trickery and ugliness.<br/>They placed emphasis on animals and often depicted monkeys in their art.<br/>Old World monkeys have trichromatic color vision like that of humans, while New World monkeys may be trichromatic, dichromatic, or\u2014as in the owl monkeys and greater galagos\u2014monochromatic.<br/>Some are arboreal (living in trees) while others live on the savanna.<br/>3 ft) long and weighing up to 36 kilograms (79 lb).<br/><br/><strong>leopard</strong><strong>: </strong>It is similar in appearance to the jaguar, but has a smaller, lighter physique, and its rosettes are generally smaller, more densely packed and without central spots.<br/>Their pelage is also more gray in colour with less defined spots.<br/>The leopard's rosettes differ from those of the jaguar, which are darker and with smaller spots inside.<br/>The cheetah has small round spots without any rosettes.<br/>Juveniles have woolly fur, and appear to be dark-coloured due to the densely arranged spots.<br/>The fur of the young tends to be longer and thicker than that of adults.<br/>The snow leopard's fur is whitish to gray with black spots on head and neck, but larger rosettes on the back, flanks and bushy tail.<br/>It is muscular, with relatively short limbs and a broad head.<br/>Its muzzle is short and its forehead domed.<br/>It is an opportunistic hunter and also eats carrion.<br/><br/><strong>giraffe</strong><strong>: </strong>These animals had bare ossicones and small cranial sinuses and were longer with broader skulls.<br/>The liver of the giraffe is small and compact.<br/>The animal's faeces come in the form of small pellets.<br/>Along the animal's neck is a mane made of short, erect hairs.<br/>The giraffe's pelvis, though relatively short, has an ilium that is outspread at the upper ends.<br/>The skin of a giraffe is mostly gray, or tan.<br/>Asian giraffes are hypothesised to have had more okapi-like colourations.<br/>Bohlinia closely resembled modern giraffes, having a long neck and legs and similar ossicones and dentition.<br/>The giraffe's molars have a rough surface.<br/>They have four chambered stomachs, as in all ruminants, and the first chamber has adapted to their specialized diet.<br/><br/><strong>terrestrial animal</strong><strong>: </strong>Among vertebrates Amphibians have this characteristic relying on a moist environment and breathing through their moist skin.<br/>Many animals considered terrestrial have a life-cycle that is partly dependent on being in water.<br/>They are adapted to most of the habitats on Earth.<br/>There are other less common terms that apply to specific groups of terrestrial animals:.<br/>Terrestrial animals do not form a unified clade.<br/>Saxicolous creatures are rock dwelling.<br/>The shell of a snail is constructed of calcium carbonate, but even in acidic soils one can find various species of shell-less slugs.<br/>Nematodes are usually microscopic with this lifestyle.<br/>Velvet worms are prone to desiccation not due to breathing through their skin but due to their spiracles being inefficient at protecting from desiccation, like Clitellates they demonstrate extensive terrestrial adaptations and differences from their marine relatives including live birth.<br/>Many other animal groups solely have terrestrial animals that live like this: Land Planarians, Land Ribbon Worms, Nematodes, and Land Annelids breathe like this.<br/><br/><strong>giraffidae</strong><strong>: </strong>They have an ambling gait similar to camels, with their weight supported alternately by their left and right legs, while their necks maintain balance.<br/>They have cloven hooves and cannon bones, much like bovids, and a complex, four-chambered stomach.<br/>Ossicones are similar to the horns of antelopes and cattle, except that they are derived from ossified cartilage or subcutaneous connective tissues rather than living bone, and that the ossicones remain covered in skin and fur, rather than horny keratin.<br/>In okapi, the male's ossicones are smaller in proportion to the head, and taper towards their tips, forming a sharper point than the comparatively blunt giraffe ossicone.<br/>Males typically have thicker ossicones that become bald on top due to frequent necking.<br/>The okapi's neck is long compared to most ruminants, but not nearly so long as the giraffe's.<br/>Ossicones are distinguished from the superficially similar structures of horns and antlers by their unique development and a permanent covering of skin and fur.<br/>They have no upper incisors or upper canines, replacing them with a tough, horny pad.<br/>however, later research has revealed these structures to be consistent with the ossicones of giraffes and okapi.<br/>Giraffids have prehensile tongues (specially adapted for grasping).<br/><br/><strong>spot</strong><strong>: </strong>The male prostate is biologically homologous to the Skene's gland.<br/>One common sex toy is the specially-designed G-spot vibrator, which is a phallus-like vibrator that has a curved tip and attempts to make G-spot stimulation easy.<br/>he states that this tissue may be part of the clitoris and is not a separate erogenous zone.<br/>For some women, stimulating this area creates a more intense orgasm than clitoral stimulation.<br/>A 2014 review from Nature Reviews Urology reported that \"no single structure consistent with a distinct G-spot has been identified.<br/>Several researchers also consider the connection between the Skene's gland and the G-spot to be weak.<br/>Objective measures have failed to provide strong and consistent evidence for the existence of an anatomical site that could be related to the famed G-spot.<br/>G-spot amplification is performed by attempting to locate the G-spot and noting measurements for future reference.<br/>G-spot vibrators are made from the same materials as regular vibrators, ranging from hard plastic, rubber, silicone, jelly, or any combination of them.<br/>Supporting Spector's conclusion is a study published in 2005 which investigates the size of the clitoris \u2013 it suggests that clitoral tissue extends into the anterior wall of the vagina.<br/><br/><strong>a pelt</strong><strong>: </strong>A pelt is the fur and skin of an animal.<br/>The midnight show covers sports events

animals</strong><strong>: </strong>The tiny placozoans are similar, but they do not have a permanent digestive chamber.<br/>All of these have a body divided into repeating segments, typically with paired appendages.<br/>They also have a gut that extends through the basically cylindrical body from mouth to anus.<br/>Two smaller phyla, the Onychophora and Tardigrada, are close relatives of the arthropods and share these traits.<br/>Animals in both phyla have distinct tissues, but these are not organised into organs.<br/>The most basal animals, the Porifera, Ctenophora, Cnidaria, and Placozoa, have body plans that lack bilateral symmetry.<br/>They have complex interactions with each other and their environments, forming intricate food webs.<br/>Animals have several characteristics that set them apart from other living things.<br/>for example, adult echinoderms are radially symmetric (unlike their larvae), while some parasitic worms have extremely simplified body structures.<br/>Some animals are capable of asexual reproduction, which often results in a genetic clone of the parent.<br/><br/><strong>lion</strong><strong>: </strong>Its skull is very similar to that of the tiger, although the frontal region is usually more depressed and flattened, and has a slightly shorter postorbital region and broader nasal openings than those of the tiger.<br/>Males have broader heads and a prominent mane that grows downwards and backwards covering most of the head, neck, shoulders, and chest.<br/>adult male lions have a prominent mane.<br/>they were larger than normal and lacked manes, and one seemed to suffer from tooth decay.<br/>Asiatic lions usually have sparser manes than average African lions.<br/>The mane is typically brownish and tinged with yellow, rust and black hairs.<br/>They were distinguished mostly by the size and colour of their manes and of their skins.<br/>the animal's expressive movements are highly developed.<br/>The male lion's mane is the most recognisable feature of the species.<br/>It has a muscular, deep-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail.<br/><br/>", "concept": "<strong>a

location is generally called the background radiation, and this is usually the case where an ambient dose rate is measured for environmental purposes.<br/>An example of this is a scintillation detector used for surface contamination monitoring.<br/>this is known as \"cosmic ray induced neutron signature\", or \"ship effect\" as it was first detected with ships at sea.<br/>The same issue occurs with radiation protection instruments, where a reading from an instrument may be affected by the background radiation.<br/>Radiation exposure from radon is indirect.<br/>This background contribution, which is established as a stable value by multiple measurements, usually before and after sample measurement, is subtracted from the rate measured when the sample is being measured.<br/>Instruments used for radiation measurement include the Geiger\u2013M\u00fcller tube and the Scintillation detector.<br/>A dental x-ray delivers a dose of 5 to 10 \u00b5Sv.<br/>The immediate dose from cosmic radiation is largely from muons, neutrons, and electrons, and this dose varies in different parts of the world based largely on the geomagnetic field and altitude.<br/>Government agencies compile radiation readings as part of environmental monitoring mandates, often making the readings available to the public and sometimes in

gender or wealth, was the simple sleeved tunic.<br/>Each home had a household shrine at which prayers and libations to the family's domestic deities were offered.<br/>The physical arrangement of the amphitheatre represented the order of Roman society: the emperor presiding in his opulent box.<br/>Roman fascination with gladiators is indicated by how widely they are depicted on mosaics, wall paintings, lamps, and even graffiti drawings.<br/>The practical source of an emperor's power and authority was the military.<br/>At Imperial public baths, a person of humble means could view wall paintings, mosaics, statues, and interior decoration often of high quality.<br/>Even after the collapse of the central government, some roads remained usable for more than a thousand years.<br/>Augustine is supposed to have said that bringing clowns, actors, and dancers into a house was like inviting in a gang of unclean spirits.<br/>A mosaic workshop was led by the master artist (pictor) who worked with two grades of assistants.<br/><br/><strong>purpose</strong><strong>: </strong>Similarly, using present tense to describe an action as ongoing may strengthen intentions to perform the same action in the future.<br/>The strict version of this view is that these functions are social actions that have been internalized.<br/>If all of these factors tend to enhance your intention to have some drinks after work, you are more likely to do so.<br/>An evolutionary perspective of this phenomenon is that humans survived on the basis of being able to predict the internal mental states and potential future actions of others.<br/>For instance, the reason you are motivated to have a few drinks after work is mostly determined by several factors.<br/>The tightening of competition between these three groups could result in a bid for the best company and possibly increase valuations.<br/>The proposed connective chain is that desire causes intention, which causes action, which causes outcome.<br/>One method of determining developmental relations between actions and an understanding of social nuances behind actions is to assess correlations between infants\u2019 reactions to actions and the frequency with which infants produce actions.<br/>For example, the use of symbols requires the ability to understand another's action and attention on an entity in the world.<br/>The next factor is the subjective norms around you.<br/><br/><strong>time</strong><strong>: </strong>However, to a stationary observer watching the spaceship fly by, the spaceship appears flattened in the direction it is traveling and the clock on board the spaceship appears to move very slowly.<br/>The most precise timekeeping device of the ancient world was the water clock, or clepsydra, one of which was found in the tomb of Egyptian pharaoh Amenhotep I.<br/>Today, the Global Positioning System in coordination with the Network Time Protocol can be used to synchronize timekeeping systems across the globe.<br/>One of the atoms used is caesium, most modern atomic clocks probe caesium with microwaves to determine the frequency of these electron vibrations.<br/>Increasingly, personal electronic devices display both calendars and clocks simultaneously.<br/>Waterclocks, and later, mechanical clocks, were used to mark the events of the abbeys and monasteries of the Middle Ages.<br/>The hourglass uses the flow of sand to measure the flow of time.<br/>A central problem with time travel to the past is the violation of causality.<br/>According to Kabbalists, \"time\" is a paradox and an illusion.<br/>Great advances in accurate time-keeping were made by Galileo Galilei and especially Christiaan Huygens with the invention of pendulum driven clocks along with the invention of the minute hand by Jost Burgi.<br/><br/><strong>to tell time</strong><strong>: </strong>A design element in the set for this series was a platform directly above and behind the emcee's desk.<br/>Also appearing on the new series was Doris Day Bowman, Anderson's mother, presented as the \"scorekeeper.<br/>The contestants stood on this platform during their introduction allowing the camera to pan directly down to the host.<br/>To host the revival series, Goodson and Todman made a call to original host Bud Collyer.<br/>Occasionally, celebrities whose faces were not well known would attempt to stump the audience during this part of the game.<br/>They then traveled down a curved staircase to the main stage level to play the game.<br/>Starting August 11, 2019, a panelist with a perfect record could receive a gold-colored statue called the Doris Award.<br/>The chair next to that was occupied by rotating guests, although voice actress Dana Hill

challengers, based on the number of incorrect votes received by the impostors.<br/><br/><strong>watch</strong><strong>: </strong>this makes it easy to change the time without removing the watch from the wrist.<br/>If one is left-handed and wears the watch on the right wrist, one has to remove the watch from the wrist to reset the time or to wind the watch.<br/>Customarily, watches provide the time of day, giving at least the hour and minute, and often the second.<br/>Some dress watches have a cabochon on the crown or faceted gemstones on the face, bezel, or bracelet.<br/>Mechanical watches often have luminous paint on their hands and hour marks.<br/>Some electronic watches are powered by the movement of the wearer.<br/>Braille watches have analog displays with raised bumps around the face to allow blind users to tell the time.<br/>A rarer configuration is the bullhead watch.<br/>Their digital equivalents use synthesised speech to speak the time on command.<br/>Today, most watches in the market that are inexpensive and medium priced, used mainly for timekeeping, have quartz movements.<br/><br/><strong>these clocks</strong><strong>: </strong>The primary purpose of a clock is to

of representing a natural number is to put down a mark for each object.<br/>An important property of the natural numbers is that they are well-ordered: every non-empty set of natural numbers has a least element.<br/>The first major advance in abstraction was the use of numerals to represent numbers.<br/>a generator set for this monoid is the set of prime numbers.<br/>With all these definitions, it is convenient to include 0 (corresponding to the empty set) as a natural number.<br/>A much later advance was the development of the idea that 0 can be considered as a number, with its own numeral.<br/>In opposition to the Naturalists, the constructivists saw a need to improve upon the logical rigor in the foundations of mathematics.<br/>One such system is ZFC with the axiom of infinity replaced by its negation.<br/>Some forms of the Peano axioms have 1 in place of 0.<br/>Even if one does not accept the axiom of infinity and therefore cannot accept that the set of all natural numbers exists, it is still possible to define any one of these sets.<br/><br/><strong>clock</strong><strong>: </strong>The primary purpose of a clock is to display the time.<br/>A major stimulus to improving

may vary).<br/>The bones involved in shaping the face are mainly the maxilla, mandible, nasal bone and zygomatic bone.<br/>The face is a part of the body, the front of the head.<br/>The pattern of specific organs, such as the eyes, or of parts of them, is used in biometric identification to uniquely identify individuals.<br/>Allen, people adapted to respond more to faces during evolution as the natural result of being a social species.<br/>By extension, anything which is the forward or world-facing part of a system which has internal structure is considered its \"face\", like the fa\u00e7ade of a building.<br/>Cosmetic surgery can be used to alter the appearance of the facial features.<br/>This is consistent with the Gestalt theory that an image is seen in its entirety, not by its individual parts.<br/>Faces are essential to expressing emotion, consciously or unconsciously.<br/>when these are damaged, it may be impossible to recognize faces even of intimate family

connected to an A.<br/><br/><strong>tell time</strong><strong>: </strong>Soon after these first mechanical clocks were in place people realized that their wheels could be used to drive an indicator on a dial on the outside of the tower, where it could be widely seen.<br/>A second type of clock face is the 24-hour analog dial, widely used in military and other organizations that use 24-hour time.<br/>Initially, the numbers were printed on small, individual plaques mounted on a brass substructure.<br/>Occasionally, markings of any sort are dispensed with, and the time is read by the angles of the hands.<br/>Most modern clocks have the numbers 1 through 12 printed at equally spaced intervals around the periphery of the face with the 12 at the top, indicating the hour, and on many models, sixty dots or lines evenly spaced in a ring around the outside of the dial, indicating minutes and seconds.<br/>These were tower clocks installed in bell towers in public places, to ensure that the bells were audible over a wide area.<br/>The time is read by observing the placement of several \"hands\", which emanate from the centre of the dial:.<br/>The clock face is so familiar that the numbers are often omitted and replaced with unlabeled graduations (marks), particularly in the case of watches.<br/>It is customary for modern advertisements to display clocks and watches set to approximately 10:10 or 1:50,.<br/>In some precision clocks, a third hand, which rotated once a minute, was added in a separate subdial.<br/><br/><strong>time zone</strong><strong>: </strong>Some junctions served by several railroads had a clock for each railroad, each showing a different time.<br/>One reason to draw time zone boundaries far to the west of their ideal meridians is to allow the more efficient use of sunlight.<br/>Some British clocks from this period have two minute hands, one for the local time and one for GMT.<br/>A common practice for space exploration is to use the Earth-based time of the launch site or mission control, synchronizing the sleeping cycles of the crew and controllers.<br/>Therefore, it is not possible to calibrate the time with respect to the Sun and still respect a 24-hour sleep/wake cycle.<br/>EDT, clocks are moved back to 1:00 a.<br/>Ships may decide to adjust their clocks at a convenient time, usually at night, not exactly when they cross a certain longitude.<br/>Since the 1920s a nautical standard time system has been in operation for ships on the high seas.<br/>In 1876, his first proposal was for a global 24-hour clock, conceptually located at the centre of the Earth and not linked to any surface meridian.<br/>9, the zoneinfo module introduces timezone management without need for third party module.<br/><br/><strong>quartz

purposes of walls in buildings are to support roofs, floors and ceilings.<br/>Scarfe was employed to produce a series of animations to be projected onto the wall.<br/>At the end of the concert, the wall collapsed, revealing the band.<br/>In addition, the wall may house various types of utilities such as electrical wiring or plumbing.<br/>The ground surface or water on one side of a retaining wall is typically higher than on the other side.<br/>Most installation companies use lattice (strips of wood) to cover the joints of the temporary wall with the ceiling.<br/>As the band played, a 40-foot (12 m) wall of cardboard bricks was gradually built between them and the audience.<br/>Some partition walls are made of sheet glass.<br/>Wall partitions are constructed using beads and tracking that is either hung from the ceiling or fixed into the ground.<br/><br/><strong>analog watch</strong><strong>: </strong>this makes it easy to change the time without removing the watch from

time of day, giving at least the hour and minute, and often the second.<br/>Some dress watches have a cabochon on the crown or faceted gemstones on the face, bezel, or bracelet.<br/>Mechanical watches often have luminous paint on their hands and hour marks.<br/>Some electronic watches are powered by the movement of the wearer.<br/>An analog watch can be used to locate north and south.<br/>Braille

Head\".<br/>A popular variant of pizza in Italy is Sicilian pizza (locally called sfincione or sfinciuni), a thick-crust or deep-dish pizza originating during the 17th century in Sicily: it is essentially a focaccia that is typically topped with tomato sauce and other ingredients.<br/>The most popular variety of pizza is called \"muzzarella\" (mozzarella), similar to Neapolitan pizza (bread, tomato sauce and cheese) but made with a thicker \"media masa\" crust, triple cheese and tomato sauce, usually also with olives.<br/>The outer edge of the pizza is sometimes referred to as the cornicione.<br/>\"Zanzibar pizza\" is a street food served in Stone Town, Zanzibar, Tanzania.<br/>Some mass-produced pizzas by fast food chains have been criticized as having an unhealthy balance of

is baked directly on a barbecue grill.<br/>Another form of uncooked pizza is available from take and bake pizzerias.<br/><br/><strong>dough</strong><strong>: </strong>Fried dough foods are also common in many cultures.<br/>This is a list of fried dough foods.<br/>Many cultures have dishes that are prepared by deep frying dough in many various forms.<br/>Fried dough foods.<br/>In countries in the Sahel region of Africa, dough balls called aiysh or biya are made from sorghum or millet, and are ground and boiled.<br/>these doughs are often called \"short\" by bakers.<br/>The process of making and shaping dough is a precursor to making a wide variety of foodstuffs, particularly breads and bread-based items, but also including biscuits, cakes, cookies, dumplings, flatbreads, noodles, pasta, pastry, pizza, piecrusts, and similar items.<br/>Techniques used in dough production depend on the type of dough and final product.<br/>While breads and other products made from doughs are often baked, some types of dough-based foods are cooked over direct heat, such as tortillas, which are cooked directly on a griddle.<br/>Doughnuts are a type of fried dough food that are covered separately in the Wikipedia article List of doughnut varieties.<br/><br/><strong>pie</strong><strong>: </strong>The Cornish pasty is an adaptation of the pie to a working man's daily food needs.<br/>The first reference to \"pyes\" as food items appeared in England (in a Latin context) as early as the 12th century), but it is not clear that this referred to baked pies.<br/>Some of these pies are pies in name only, such as the Boston cream pie, which is a cake.<br/>Many sweet pies are served this way.<br/>The largest pies of the era were \"standing pies\", which were baked with steam holes, which were then sealed with melted butter (which would harden to seal the pie), and then eaten over several months.<br/>Early pies were in the form of flat, round or freeform crusty cakes called galettes consisting of a crust of ground oats, wheat, rye, or barley containing honey inside.<br/>Settlers' recipes were for English-style meat pies.<br/>Some pies contained cooked rabbits, frogs, crows, and pigeons.<br/>Swedish immigrants in the plains states brought recipes for fish pie and berry pie.<br/>Also called libum by the Romans, it was more like a modern-day cheesecake on a pastry base, often used as an offering to the gods.<br/><br/><strong>bread</strong><strong>: </strong>Most bread eaten in the West is leavened.<br/>Nutritionally, bread is categorized as a source of grains in the food pyramid.<br/>Professional bread recipes are stated using the baker's percentage notation.<br/>Unleavened breads, such as the tortilla and roti, are staple foods in Central America and South Asia, respectively.<br/>Common table breads made from these doughs result in a finely textured, light bread.<br/>A simple technique for leavening bread is the use of gas-producing chemicals.<br/>Because air pockets within this gluten network result from carbon dioxide production during leavening, bread can be defined as a foam, or a gas-in-solid solution.<br/>Many breads are leavened by yeast.<br/>The crust of most breads is harder, and more complexly and intensely flavored, than the rest.<br/>Words for bread, including \"dough\" and \"bread\" itself, are used in English-speaking countries as synonyms for money.<br/><br/><strong>brown bread</strong><strong>: </strong>This list does not include cakes, pastries, or fried dough foods, which are listed in separate Wikipedia articles.<br/>It also does not list foods in which bread is an ingredient which is processed further before serving.<br/>The brown colour of whole grain breads is caused by cerealine, a discovery attributed to Hippolyte M\u00e8ge-Mouri\u00e8s of France.<br/>In some regions of the US, the bread is simply called wheat bread in contrast to white bread.<br/>Furthermore, bread plays an essential role in both religious rituals and secular culture.<br/>This is a list of notable baked or steamed bread varieties.<br/>The new system of making bread.<br/>In England, brown bread was made from brown meal.<br/>In Ireland, during the Famine, prior to 1848, brown bread was handed out to the poor.<br/>The moist bread is dark in colour and traditionally served with baked beans and franks.<br/><br/><strong>cookies</strong><strong>: </strong>If cookies were used in this situation, the cookies would be the same.<br/>Other types of cookies are classified for other reasons, such as their ingredients, size, or intended time of serving:.<br/>Cookies that are baked as a solid layer on a sheet pan and then cut, rather than being baked as individual pieces, are called in British English bar cookies or traybakes.<br/>Chewier biscuits are sometimes called cookies even in the United Kingdom.<br/>These very large cookies are sold at grocery stores, restaurants and coffeeshops.<br/>In most English-speaking countries except for the United States, crunchy cookies are called biscuits.<br/>A cookie is a baked or cooked food that is typically small, flat and sweet.<br/>The container used to store cookies may be called a cookie jar.<br/>One of the most popular early cookies, which traveled especially well and became known on every continent by similar names, was the jumble, a relatively hard cookie made largely from nuts, sweetener, and water.<br/>In the UK, the term \"cookie\" often refers only to this particular type of product.<br/><br/><strong>bhakri</strong><strong>: </strong>The preparation is similar to jowar bhakris.<br/>The dough is split into little balls.<br/>Bhakri (bh\u0101kri, bhakkari) is a round bread often used in the cuisine of the states of Maharashtra, Gujarat  and Goa in India, along with several regions of western and central India, including areas of Rajasthan and Malwa and Karnataka in South India.<br/>List of Indian breads.<br/>Different types of millets (jowar, bajra, nachni) are the more common grains used for making bhakris.<br/>These millet bhakris are popular in the Deccan plateau regions of India (Maharashtra and Northern Karnataka) as well as the semi-arid regions of Rajasthan.<br/>The dough is prepared by mixing jowar flour with hot water and then flattened by hand.<br/>They are prepared similar to other bhakris.<br/>They are common in the Konkan region.<br/>In the coastal Konkan and Goa regions of western India rice flour is used for making bhakri.<br/><br/><strong>cake</strong><strong>: </strong>Highly decorated sponge cakes with lavish toppings are sometimes called gateau, the French word for cake.<br/>Another type of butter cake that takes its names from the proportion of ingredients used is 1-2-3-4 cake: 1 cup butter, 2 cups sugar, 3 cups flour, and 4 eggs.<br/>One egg cakes are made with one egg.<br/>They also had a cake called \"satura\", which was a flat heavy cake.<br/>The most commonly used cake ingredients include flour, sugar, eggs, butter or oil or margarine, a liquid, and a leavening agent, such as baking soda or baking powder.<br/>other cakes associated with Christmas include chocolate log and mince pies.<br/>These cakes often have a crumb topping called streusel or a light glaze drizzle.<br/>Traditional sponge cakes are leavened only with eggs.<br/>A cake is a sweet, baked form of food.<br/>Early cakes in England were also essentially bread: the most obvious differences between a \"cake\" and \"bread\" were the round, flat shape of the cakes, and the cooking method, which turned cakes over once while cooking, while bread was left upright throughout the baking process.<br/><br/><strong>the

"wiki": "<strong>foam</strong><strong>: </strong>Memory foam consists mainly of polyurethane as well as additional chemicals increasing its viscosity and density.<br/>Memory foam, like other polyurethane products, can be combustible.<br/>Polyethylene terephthalate is one such polymeric material, which provides certain benefits over polyurethane, such as recyclability, lightness, and thermal insulation.<br/>Other materials, apart from polyurethane, have also been shown to exhibit the properties necessary to make memory foam.<br/>The pneumatic effect is caused by the time it takes for air to flow into the porous structure of the foam.<br/>The HAP emissions associated with polyurethane foam production include methylene chloride, toluene diisocyanate, methyl chloroform, methylene diphenyl diisocyanate, propylene oxide, diethanolamine, methyl ethyl ketone, methanol, and toluene.<br/>The United States Environmental Protection Agency published two documents proposing National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAP) concerning hazardous emissions produced during the making of flexible polyurethane foam products.<br/>The force working against the buoyancy force is the surface tension force, which is.<br/>A camping mat is an example of a closed-cell foam: gas pockets are sealed from each other so the mat cannot soak up water.<br/>The spheres can be made from several materials, including glass, ceramic, and polymers.<br/><br/><strong>the object</strong><strong>: </strong>The prototype of an object is just another object to which the object is linked.<br/>Another scripting language that takes this approach is Lua.<br/>For example, objects of type Circle and Square are derived from a common class called Shape.<br/>This variable is late-bound.<br/>every object has its own copy of each one.<br/>New objects can be created based on already existing objects chosen as their prototype.<br/>In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another.<br/>It claims that everything is an object.<br/>A more complex example would be a command consisting of the length and code point of the command and values consisting of linearized objects representing the command's parameters.<br/>The idea of the fruit class doesn't exist explicitly, but as the equivalence class of the objects sharing the same prototype.<br/><br/><strong>styrofoam</strong><strong>: </strong>The claimed R-value of Styrofoam insulation is five per inch.<br/>The trademarked term is used generically although it is a different material from the extruded polystyrene used for Styrofoam insulation.<br/>Styrofoam is composed of 98% air, making it lightweight and buoyant.<br/>In the United States and Canada, the colloquial use of the word styrofoam refers to another material that is usually white in color and made of expanded (not extruded) polystyrene foam (EPS).<br/>Styrofoam is a brand of insulation made from extruded polystyrene foam.<br/>Dow insulation Styrofoam has a distinctive blue color.<br/>Dow also produces Styrofoam as structural insulated panels for use by florists and in craft products.<br/>Dow produces Styrofoam building materials, including varieties of building insulation sheathing and pipe insulation.<br/>The Styrofoam brand polystyrene foam, which is used for craft applications, can be identified by its roughness and the \"crunch\" it makes when cut.<br/>Styrofoam has a variety of uses.<br/><br/><strong>touch</strong><strong>: </strong>The form of touch where localization is not possible is known as crude touch.<br/>Then the subject will feel the touch, but be unable to identify where they were touched.<br/>\"Force can overcome object geometry in the perception of shape through active touch\" (PDF).<br/>One well-studied area is passive tactile spatial acuity, the ability to resolve the fine spatial details of an object pressed against the stationary skin.<br/>The second-order neuron has its cell body either in the spinal cord or in the brainstem.<br/>Haptic technology can provide touch sensation in virtual and real environments.<br/>The tactile feedback from proprioception is derived from the proprioceptors in the skin, muscles, and joints.<br/>This type of information is actually coded differently than other sensory information.<br/>The density of tactile corpuscles, a type of mechanoreceptor that detects low-frequency vibrations, is greater in smaller fingers.<br/>The somatosensory system is spread through all major parts of the vertebrate body.<br/><br/><strong>fiberglass</strong><strong>: </strong>Storage tanks can be made of fiberglass with capacities up to about 300 tonnes.<br/>The component-making process involves building up a component on the fiberglass mold.<br/>A fiberglass component is typically of a thin \"shell\" construction, sometimes filled on the inside with structural foam, as in the case of surfboards.<br/>The plug can be made from a variety of materials, usually certain types of foam.<br/>One notable feature of fiberglass is that the resins used are subject to contraction during the curing process.<br/>The fiberglass used will typically be identical to that which will be used in the final product.<br/>The process of manufacturing fiberglass is called pultrusion.<br/>The mold is a negative image of the component to be made, so the fiberglass will be applied inside the mold, rather than around it.<br/>The process usually involves first making a mold and then using the mold to make the fiberglass component.<br/>The fiberglass mold process begins with an object known as the plug or buck.<br/><br/><strong>surfing</strong><strong>: </strong>Most modern surfboards are made of fiberglass foam (PU), with one or more wooden strips or \"stringers\", fiberglass cloth, and polyester resin (PE).<br/>An emerging board material is epoxy resin and Expanded Polystyrene foam (EPS) which is stronger and lighter than traditional PU/PE construction.<br/>The water in the jet is sediment rich, bubble rich, and moves rapidly.<br/>The closest form of body surfing using a board is a handboard which normally has one strap over it to fit on one hand.<br/>A newer introduction is a rash vest with a thin layer of titanium to provide maximum warmth without compromising mobility.<br/>The reef is usually made of coral, and because of this, many injuries occur while surfing reef breaks.<br/>Even newer designs incorporate materials such as carbon fiber and variable-flex composites in conjunction with fiberglass and epoxy or polyester resins.<br/>The basic idea is to position the surfboard so it is just ahead of the breaking part (whitewash) of the wave.<br/>Their pae po\u02bbo (bodyboards) as well as kiko\u02bbo and alaia surfboards were made from koa.<br/>The code of kapu assigned the proper length of boards to be used, according to the status of the rider.<br/><br/><strong>hand</strong><strong>: </strong>The web of the hand is a \"fold of skin which connects the digits\".<br/>The central-most metacarpal (middle finger) is the most rigid.<br/>All parts of the skin involved in grasping are covered by papillary ridges (fingerprints) acting as friction pads.<br/>The fist is compact and thus effective as a weapon.<br/>The hand is located at the distal end of each arm.<br/>The four fingers can be folded over the palm which allows the grasping of objects.<br/>The extensors are situated within 6 separate compartments.<br/>The primary function of the extensors is to straighten out the digits.<br/>A common fracture of the hand is a scaphoid fracture\u2014a fracture of the scaphoid bone, one of the carpal bones.<br/>The fingers may be fused in a disorder known as syndactyly.<br/><br/><strong>surfing equipment</strong><strong>: </strong>Most modern surfboards are made of fiberglass foam (PU),

river.<br/>A type 3 jetty is in an ebb tidal area with an unchanging seabed that has naturally created waves.<br/><br/><strong>red boat</strong><strong>: </strong>The original four ships had the prefix \"Star/Ship\" before their names.<br/>The successful niche that Premier served was the family cruise line, especially attractive to grandparents sailing with their children and grandchildren.<br/>It is said that the actor originally used a purple cave boat as a theater boat, and later added sails to paint dragon scales and chrysanthemums on the hull.<br/>The older ships were designed before the current disability acts, requiring reasonable access for persons with physical disabilities, were even envisioned, let alone enacted into law.<br/>The pattern, the bow is painted red, so it is called the red boat.<br/>The Big Red Boat III, formerly Carnival Cruise Line's Festivale, was also sold for scrap.<br/>The Big Red Boat II, formerly Eugenio Costa, was put up for sale and was laid up in Freeport, Bahamas.<br/>The company earned over $20 million annually on a gross revenue of $100 million during the 1980s.<br/>The company had an aging fleet of Italian-designed ships competing with newer and larger liners.<br/>At the same time, Wing Chun was taught to the outside world.<br/><br/><strong>plastic</strong><strong>: </strong>Futuro houses are made of fiberglass-reinforced polyesters, polyester-polyurethane, and PMMA.<br/>The majority of biocides are added to soft PVC and foamed polyurethanes.<br/>In the medical field, polymer implants and other medical devices are derived at least partially from plastic.<br/>Several species of soil fungi can consume polyurethane, including two species of the Ecuadorian fungus Pestalotiopsis.<br/>They can consume polyurethane both aerobically and anaerobically (such as at the bottom of landfills).<br/>Meanwhile, 50% to 80% of debris in marine areas is plastic.<br/>If the plastic is incinerated, it increases carbon emissions.<br/>Important groups classified in this way include the acrylics, polyesters, silicones, polyurethanes, and halogenated plastics.<br/>Plastic items containing plasticizers can exhibit improved flexibility and durability.<br/>These so-called semi-crystalline plastics include polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, polyamides (nylons), polyesters and some polyurethanes.<br/><br/><strong>polyurethane</strong><strong>: </strong>Degradation of polyurethane items at museums has been reported.<br/>The two components are referred to as a polyurethane system, or simply a system.<br/>Fully reacted polyurethane polymer is chemically inert.<br/>In some respects a piece of polyurethane can be regarded as one giant molecule.<br/>One of the most desirable attributes of polyurethanes is their ability to be turned into foam.<br/>The main ingredients to make a polyurethane are di- and tri-isocyanates and polyols.<br/>The crosslinking present in polyurethanes means that the polymer consists of a three-dimensional network and molecular weight is very high.<br/>Isocyanates used to make polyurethane have two or more isocyanate groups on each molecule.<br/>High-performance, flexible polyurethane elastomers are also used in this way.<br/>The properties of a polyurethane are greatly influenced by the types of isocyanates and polyols used to make it.<br/><br/><strong>surfboard</strong><strong>: </strong>Modern surfboards are made of polyurethane or polystyrene foam covered with layers of fiberglass cloth, and polyester or epoxy resin.<br/>Its polyurethane foam and fiberglass design allows less drag on waves.<br/>Another method of making boards is using epoxy resin and prolapse polystyrene foam, instead of polyester resin and polyurethane foam.<br/>Finally, the board is covered in one or more layers of fiberglass cloth and resin.<br/>Surfboards have traditionally been constructed using polyurethane foam and it remains a popular choice.<br/>All surfboards made of foam and resin can face the problem of delamination.<br/>Modern surfboards are usually made of foam using one of the following construction materials:.<br/>The \"skin\", made of a gloss coated foam, is stretched and adhered while vacuumed over the  surface of the entire epoxy surfboard.<br/>Most modern surfboards are made of fiberglass foam (PU), with one or more wooden strips or \"stringers\", fiberglass cloth, and polyester resin (PE).<br/>Another drawback with EPS foam is that it absorbs water more easily.<br/><br/><strong>the

disk.<br/>Their reflected-light television system included both small and large viewing screens.<br/>The brightness of the neon lamp was varied in proportion to the brightness of each spot on the image.<br/>The slang term \"the tube\" or the \"boob tube\" derives from the bulky cathode ray tube used on most TVs until the advent of flat-screen TVs.<br/><br/><strong>hearth</strong><strong>: </strong>Later, the hearth was moved to the side of the room and provided with a chimney.<br/>The numbers of hearths are generally proportional to the size of the house.<br/>This function operates in the manner of database technology.<br/>The original Hearth Money Rolls are not extant.<br/>The measure was apparently a consequence of parliamentary pressure in the previous session.<br/>The bill was subsequently amended so that the tax was paid by the occupier.<br/>The returns were lodged with the Clerk of the Peace between 1662 and 1688.<br/>The method of connecting bands of hearth numbers to social categories was pioneered by William George Hoskins, looking at the city of Exeter.<br/>All searches are linked to a databasket function whereby groups of entries from the search enquiries are brought together which the user can store for further analysis, or indeed bring together a series of single entries highlighted from reading the returns in the records pages.<br/>The comprehensiveness

that could be rolled up and retract automatically with the push of a button come 2019.<br/>Since 2008, LG Electronics remains the world's second-largest LCD television manufacturer.<br/>In 2016, exclusively to India, Indian arm of South Korea's LG Electronics Inc started selling a TV that would repel mosquitoes.<br/>it was the second-largest LCD TV manufacturer worldwide as of 2013.<br/>Many consumer electronics were sold under the brand name GoldStar, while some other household products (not available outside South Korea) were sold under the brand name of Lucky.<br/>As of 2014, LG is

cost of a show and a network pays a license fee to the studio for the right to air the show.<br/>The longer duration on the BBC is due to the lack of advertising breaks.<br/>The content in a television show can be produced with different methodologies such as taped variety shows emanating from a television studio stage, animation or a variety of film productions ranging from movies to series.<br/>Most television networks throughout the world are 'commercial', dependent on selling advertising time or acquiring sponsors.<br/>A standard television season in the United States runs predominantly across the fall and winter, from late September to May.<br/>The production company is often separate from the broadcaster.<br/>Most programs broadcast by Ion Television are distributed by either NBCUniversal Television Distribution, 20th Century Fox Television, or CBS Television Distribution.<br/>A scene is further divided into shots, which should be planned during pre-production.<br/>In France most television shows (whether dramas, game shows or documentaries) have a duration of 52 minutes.<br/>The first television shows were experimental, sporadic broadcasts viewable only within a very short range from the broadcast tower starting in the 1930s.<br/><br/><strong>samsung</strong><strong>: </strong>The TV section shows off their big-screen TVs.<br/>The basic

he invented an early form of storage room heater.<br/>He spent time looking for a practical route to transport ore and equipment, settling on using the San Juan River, the Sarapiqui River, and then a railway to cover the remaining distance.<br/>He also introduced the hydraulic testing of boilers, and the use of a mercury manometer to indicate the pressure.<br/>He also built a barge powered by paddle wheels and several dredgers.<br/>This is widely recognised as the first demonstration of transportation powered by steam.<br/>He also experimented with the plunger-pole pump, a type of pump\u2014with a beam engine\u2014used widely in Cornwall's tin mines, in which he reversed the plunger to change it into a water-power engine.<br/>had also concerned himself with the concept, but there is no indication that his ideas had ever come to Trevithick's attention.<br/>He worked on building and modifying steam engines to avoid the royalties due to Watt on the separate condenser patent.<br/>He was an early pioneer of steam-powered road and rail transport, and his most significant contributions were the development of the first high-pressure steam engine and the first working railway steam locomotive.<br/>William Murdoch had developed and demonstrated a model steam carriage, initially in 1784, and demonstrated it to Trevithick at his request in 1794.<br/><br/><strong>blaise pascal</strong><strong>: </strong>He introduced a primitive form of roulette and the roulette wheel in his search for a perpetual motion machine.<br/>He demonstrated this principle by attaching a thin tube to a barrel full of water and filling the tube with water up to the level of the third floor of a building.<br/>He proved that hydrostatic pressure depends not on the weight of the fluid but on the elevation difference.<br/>Blaise Pascal's works: text, concordances and frequency lists.<br/>Blaise Pascal featured on the 500 French Franc banknote in 1977.<br/>Blaise Pascal at the Mathematics Genealogy Project.<br/>he wrote a significant treatise on the subject of projective geometry at the age of 16.<br/>Pascal also used De l'Esprit g\u00e9om\u00e9trique to develop a theory of definition.<br/>Scuba divers must understand this principle.<br/>Pascal continued to make improvements to his design through the next decade, and he refers to some 50 machines that were built to his design.<br/><br/><strong>dean kamen</strong><strong>: </strong>He hopes the project will help improve living standards in developing countries.<br/>Kamen has a patent on his water purifier, and other patents pending.<br/>Kamen is best known for inventing the product that eventually became known as the Segway PT, an electric, self-balancing human transporter with a computer-controlled gyroscopic stabilization and control system.<br/>Dean Kamen has developed a series plug-in hybrid car using a Ford Think and a Stirling engine.<br/>He is known for his invention of the Segway and iBOT, as well as founding the non-profit organization FIRST with Woodie Flowers.<br/>In 2003, his \"Project Slingshot,\" a cheap portable water purification system, was named a runner-up for \"coolest invention of 2003\" by Time magazine.<br/>In 2009, development of the two-wheeled Personal Urban Mobility and Accessibility (PUMA) vehicle was announced in

concept Baudry moved to Paris and launched the first omnibus service there in April 1828.<br/>Public long-distance coach networks are also often used as a low-cost method of travel by students or young people travelling the world.<br/>His transport scheme was a huge success, although not as he had intended as most of his passengers did not visit his spa.<br/>Historically, the types and features of buses have developed according to local needs.<br/>Sir William first proposed the idea in an article to the Journal of the Society of Arts in 1881 as an \".<br/>Schools often hire charter bus services on regular basis for transportation of children to and from their homes.<br/>In some countries, particularly the US and Canada, buses used to transport schoolchildren have evolved into a

cheapest mode of transport but are not necessarily flexible, and taxis are very flexible but more expensive.<br/>sledge) helped make animal transport more efficient through the introduction of vehicles.<br/>Humans' first means of transport involved walking, running and swimming.<br/>The invention of the steam engine, closely followed by its application in rail transport, made land transport independent of human or animal muscles.<br/>This flexibility of changes in location, direction, speed, and timings of travel is not available to other modes of transport.<br/>Although it is slow compared to other transport, modern sea transport is a highly efficient method of transporting large quantities of goods.<br/>It is possible to provide door-to-door service only by road transport.<br/>buses allow for more efficient travel at the cost of reduced flexibility.<br/>The domestication of animals introduced a new way to lay the burden of transport on more powerful creatures, allowing the hauling of heavier loads, or humans riding animals for greater speed and duration.<br/><br/><strong>aarp</strong><strong>: </strong>But Rother admitted that it would be

achievement.<br/>Bell worked extensively in medical research and invented techniques for teaching speech to the deaf.<br/>Bell began a series of public demonstrations and lectures to introduce the new invention to the scientific community as well as the general public.<br/>He also developed a technique of speaking in clear, modulated tones directly into his mother's forehead wherein she would hear him with reasonable clarity.<br/>Bell and his assistant Charles Sumner Tainter jointly invented a wireless telephone, named a photophone, which allowed for the transmission of both sounds and normal human conversations on a beam of light.<br/>But he had no working model to demonstrate the feasibility of these ideas.<br/>This led him and Bell to the development of practical hydrofoil watercraft.<br/>This interest in animal breeding caught the attention of scientists focused on the study of heredity and genetics in humans.<br/>Gray had reinvented the variable resistance telephone, but Bell was the first to write down the idea and the first to test it in a telephone.<br/>Baldwin studied the work of the Italian inventor Enrico Forlanini and began testing models.<br/><br/><strong>railing</strong><strong>: </strong>It used cast iron for the first time as arches to cross the river Severn.<br/>There are several methods used to monitor the condition of large structures like bridges.<br/>Additionally, this method can measure specific points on a bridge that might be difficult to access.<br/>The advantage of this method is that the setup time for the equipment is faster and, unlike an accelerometer, this makes measurements possible on multiple structures in as short a time as possible.<br/>The simplest and earliest types of bridges were stepping stones.<br/>There are many different designs that each serve a particular purpose and apply to different situations.<br/>The Ashanti built bridges over streams and rivers.<br/>Others have used microsimulation to generate typical clusters of vehicles on the bridge.<br/>During the 18th century there were many innovations in the design of timber bridges by Hans Ulrich Grubenmann, Johannes Grubenmann, and others.<br/>Most bridges will employ all of these to some degree, but only a few will predominate.<br/><br/><strong>sign</strong><strong>: </strong>Augustine endorsed and developed the classical and Hellenistic theories of signs.<br/>BBN Technologies' Ray Tomlinson is credited with introducing this usage in 1971.<br/>God gave signs as a means to reveal himself.<br/>Augustine was the first man who synthesized the classical and Hellenistic theories of signs.<br/>The evolution of the symbol as used today is not recorded.<br/>Currently, the word arroba means both the at-symbol and a

transformation occurred most dramatically in the US\u2014where corporate and governmental policies favored automobile transport systems\u2014and to a lesser extent in Europe.<br/>Since the mid-twentieth century, cities have relied heavily on motor vehicle transportation, with major implications for their layout, environment, and aesthetics.<br/>Some cities have introduced bus rapid transit systems which include exclusive bus lanes and other methods for prioritizing bus traffic over private cars.<br/>Technologies, techniques, and laws governing these areas\u2014developed in cities\u2014have become ubiquitous in many areas.<br/>Cities also rely on long-distance transportation (truck, rail, and airplane) for economic connections with other cities and rural areas.<br/>The urban bus system, the world's most common form of public transport, uses a network of scheduled routes to move people through the city, alongside cars, on the roads.<br/>China's planned cities were constructed according to sacred principles to act as celestial microcosms.<br/>Cities rely to a lesser extent on hydrocarbon fuels such as gasoline and natural gas for transportation, heating, and cooking.<br/>Rapid transit is widely used in Europe and has increased in Latin America and Asia.<br/>More and more cities today draw on this globally available labor force.<br/><br/><strong>this

the Laplace transform.<br/>The validity of this identity can be proved by other means.<br/>He then went on to apply the Laplace transform in the same way and started to derive some of its properties, beginning to appreciate its potential power.<br/>It was often used, especially in handwriting, as the currency sign for the Italian lira.<br/>He used an integral of the form.<br/>The theory was further developed in the 19th and early 20th centuries by Mathias Lerch, Oliver Heaviside, and Thomas Bromwich.<br/>In Japan, for example, this is the symbol for the liter.<br/>However, a different point of view and different characteristic problems are associated with each of these four major integral transforms.<br/>In addition, the Laplace transform has large applications in control

and a new kind of abstraction by dripping, pouring, splashing and splattering paint onto un-stretched canvas lying on the floor.<br/>History shows that turning the concept of an invention into a working device is not always swift or direct.<br/>For example, the parachute became more useful once powered flight was a reality.<br/>Sometimes inventors disregard the boundaries between distinctly separate territories or fields.<br/>Working on one invention can lead to others too.<br/>Such works are novel and not obvious to others skilled in the same field.<br/>It may begin by recognizing that something unusual or accidental may be useful or that it could open a new avenue for exploration.<br/>Inventions often extend the boundaries of human knowledge, experience or capability.<br/>Impressionist painting became possible because of newly invented collapsible, resealable metal paint tubes that facilitated spontaneous painting outdoors.<br/>An open and curious mind allows an inventor to see beyond what is known.<br/><br/><strong>transport</strong><strong>: </strong>The railroads invented the career path in the private sector for both blue-collar workers and
