English) are \"low-tech\" athletic shoes and are also called \"sneakers\" in American English.<br/>This style of footwear also became prominent in America at the turn of the 20th century, where they were called 'sneakers'.<br/>In Geordie English, sneakers may also be called sandshoes, gym boots, or joggers.<br/>while plimsolls may be referred to as daps in Welsh English.<br/>The term \"sneakers\" is most commonly used in Northeastern United States, Central and South Florida, New Zealand, and parts of Canada.<br/>Tennis shoes is another term used in Australian, and North American English.<br/>The shoes themselves are made of flexible compounds, typically featuring a sole made of dense rubber.<br/>Sneakers (also called trainers, athletic shoes, tennis shoes, gym shoes, kicks, sport shoes, flats, running shoes, skate shoes, or runners) are shoes primarily designed for sports or other forms of physical exercise but that are now also widely used for everyday casual wear.<br/>An example of this is the spiked shoe developed for track running.<br/>The term 'athletic shoes' is typically used for shoes utilized for jogging or road running and indoor sports such as basketball, but tends to exclude shoes for sports played on grass such as association football and rugby football, which are generally known in North America as \"cleats\" and in British English as \"boots\" or \"studs\".<br/><br/><br/><strong>white shoe</strong><strong>: </strong>The phrase \"white shoe\" has a distinctly different meaning and history in Australia.<br/>it is also sometimes used in a derogatory manner to denote stodginess, elitism, or a lack of diversity.<br/>The following US firms are often referred to as being white-shoe firms:.<br/>A similar term in Australia, \"white shoe brigade\", has been used in the past to describe a group of Queensland property developers who backed, and benefitted from, former Queensland State Premier Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen.<br/>The phrase derives from \"white bucks\", laced suede or buckskin shoes with a red sole, long popular among the student body of Ivy League colleges.<br/>\" In the 21st century, the term is sometimes used in a general sense to refer to firms that are perceived as prestigious or high-quality.<br/>The term historically had antisemitic connotations, as many of the New York firms known as \"white shoe\" were considered off-limits to Jews until the 1960s.<br/>Silver Circle is an informal term for perceived elite corporate law firms headquartered in the United Kingdom that are the main competitors for the magic circle.<br/>The term typically, though not always, refers to financial, law, and management consulting firms, traditionally those based in the Northeastern United States, including New York City and Boston.<br/>The term is a contemptuous allusion to the lower social class antecedents of such men, revealed by their gaudy and tasteless choice of clothing, which included brightly coloured or patterned shirts, slacks with white stripes or in pastel shades, and shoes and belts of white leather, these often having gold or gilt buckles.<br/><br/><br/><strong>call</strong><strong>:

</strong>The Locher rack also requires transfer tables.<br/>The Lamella system (also known as the Von Roll system) was developed by the Von Roll company after the rolled steel rails used in the Strub system became unavailable.<br/>It uses a ladder rack, formed of steel plates or channels connected by round or square rods at regular intervals.<br/>The Abt system is cheaper to build than the Riggenbach because it requires a lower weight of rack over a given length.<br/>The Strub rack system was invented by Emil Strub in 1896.<br/>The Fell mountain railway system, developed in the 1860s, is not strictly speaking a rack railway, since there are no cogs with teeth.<br/>The Riggenbach system is similar in design to the Marsh system.<br/>The Lamella rack can be used by locomotives designed for use on the Riggenbach or the Strub systems, so long as the safety-jaws that were a feature of the original Strub system are not used.<br/>The Morgan rack was good for grades of up to 16 percent.<br/>The Abt system was also used for the construction of the Snowdon Mountain Railway in Wales from 1894 to 1896.<br/><br/><br/><strong>white shoes</strong><strong>: </strong>The phrase

weather</strong><strong>: </strong>Most people can dress appropriately and can even layer their clothing should they need to go outside or should their heating fail.<br/>Minnesota experienced a rare May snowstorm as a result of this cold wave.<br/>Globally, more people die during hot weather than cold weather.<br/>Some places like Germany, France, Italy, Romania and Spain had record cold temperatures well below 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F).<br/>Fires become even more of a hazard during extreme cold.<br/>Some may even choose to migrate to places of milder climates, at least during the winter.<br/>Both cold waves and heat waves cause deaths, though different groups of people may be susceptible to different weather events.<br/>A cold wave can cause death and injury to livestock and wildlife.<br/>Extreme winter cold often causes poorly insulated water pipelines and mains to freeze.<br/>In some places, such as Siberia, extreme cold requires that fuel-powered machinery to be used even part-time must be run continuously.<br/><br/><br/><strong>cloth</strong><strong>: </strong>Animal textiles are commonly made from hair, fur, skin or silk (in the case of silkworms).<br/>Some weaving is still done by hand, but the vast majority is mechanized.<br/>The cloth was most likely made by the native Asia people of northwest Romblon.<br/>Textiles are often dyed, with fabrics available in almost every colour.<br/>The speed and scale of textile production has been altered almost beyond recognition by industrialization and the introduction of modern manufacturing techniques.<br/>Cotton, flax, jute, hemp, modal and even banana and bamboo fibre are all used in clothing.<br/>Due to the often highly technical and legal requirements of these products, these textiles are typically tested in order to ensure they meet stringent performance requirements.<br/>Polyester fibre is used in all types of clothing, either alone or blended with fibres such as cotton.<br/>Straw and bamboo are both used to make hats.<br/>Different types of rayon can imitate the feel and texture of silk, cotton, wool, or linen.<br/><br/><br/><strong>sport</strong><strong>: </strong>Sport betting is in some cases severely regulated, and in some cases is central to the sport.<br/>These trends are seen by many as contrary to the fundamental ethos of sport being carried on for its own sake and for the enjoyment of its participants.<br/>Germany used the Olympics to give off a peaceful image while secretly preparing for war.<br/>Other organisations, such as the Council of Europe, preclude activities without a physical element from classification as sports.<br/>Some sports also use it to allow off-field decision making.<br/>Nationalism is often evident in the pursuit of sport, or in its reporting: people compete in national teams, or commentators and audiences can adopt a partisan view.<br/>The competitive nature of sport encourages some participants to attempt to enhance their performance through the use of medicines, or through other means such as increasing the volume of blood in their bodies through artificial means.<br/>Other bodies advocate widening the definition of sport to include all physical activity.<br/>The practice of athletic competitions has been criticised by some Christian thinkers as a form of idolatry, in which \"human beings extol themselves, adore themselves, sacrifice themselves and reward themselves.<br/>As many Greeks travelled to see the games, this combination of religion and sport also served as a way of uniting them.<br/><br/><br/><strong>these men</strong><strong>: </strong>Five mutants are discovering their abilities while held in a secret facility against their will.<br/>They will fight to escape their

</strong>Comprehensive protection against the cold is particularly important for children and for sports.<br/>Mercury is cold during its night because it has no atmosphere to trap in heat from the Sun.<br/>Soviet investment in the defense sector was not driven by military necessity, but in large part by the interests of massive party and state bureaucracies dependent on the sector for their own power and privileges.<br/>Soviet radio broadcasts used Marxist rhetoric to attack capitalism, emphasizing themes of labor exploitation, imperialism and war-mongering.<br/>Very few people have a perfectly clean slate and so are available to fill the positions that require significant expertise.<br/>After 45\u201370 years of communist rule, nearly every family has members associated with the

the first physiological responses to cold.<br/>Local frostbite leads to so-called chilblains or even to the death of entire body parts.<br/><br/><br/><strong>stay warm</strong><strong>: </strong>Heating is expensive because of the lack of insulation and the draftiness of housing.<br/>This kotatsu came about with the popular use of tatami matting in Japanese homes.<br/>A kotatsu is a relatively inexpensive way to stay warm in the winter, as the futons trap the warm air.<br/>Families may choose to concentrate their activity in this one area of the house in order to save on energy costs.<br/>Most Japanese housing is not insulated to the same degree as a Western domicile and does not have central heating, thus relying primarily on space heating.<br/>The kotatsu was designed when people most commonly wore traditional Japanese style clothes, where the heat would enter through the bottom of the robes and rise to exit around the neck, thus heating the entire body.<br/>Traditionally, children are told that they will catch a cold if they sleep under a kotatsu.<br/>Thus, the kotatsu became completely mobile with electricity and became a common feature of Japanese homes during winter.<br/>The kotatsu usually is set on a thin futon, like a throw rug.<br/>During the winter months in Japan, the kotatsu often is the center of domestic life.<br/><br/><br/><strong>man</strong><strong>: </strong>In all cultures in the past, and still among traditional and non-Western cultures, getting married is the most common and definitive distinction between boyhood and manhood.<br/>In Western culture, for example, greater masculinity usually brings greater social status.<br/>While the majority of men are heterosexual, significant minorities are homosexual or bisexual.<br/>Although in general men suffer from many of the same illnesses as women, they suffer from slightly more illnesses in comparison to women.<br/>Secondary sexual characteristics that are specific to men include:.<br/>Some men identify as mostly straight.<br/>Male sexuality and attraction vary from person to person, and a man's sexual behavior can be affected by many factors, including evolved predispostions, personality, upbringing, and culture.<br/>To what extent masculinity is biologically or socially influenced is subject to debate.<br/>Many English words such as virtue and virile (from the Indo-European root vir meaning man) reflect this.<br/>This difference in the relative amounts of these sex steroids is largely responsible for the physiological differences that distinguish men from women.<br/><br/><br/>", "concept": "<strong>sport</strong><strong>: </strong>whitewater rafting is related to sport<br/>ferret legging is related to

linearizations of objects defined by class objects known to both the client and the server.<br/><br/><br/><strong>west</strong><strong>: </strong>In a map with north at the top, west is on the left.<br/>West is the direction opposite that of the Earth's rotation on its axis, and is therefore the general direction towards which the Sun appears to constantly progress and eventually set.<br/>To an observer on the surface of Venus, the Sun would rise in the west and set in the east although Venus's opaque clouds prevent observing the Sun from the planet's surface.<br/>According to the Bible, the Israelites crossed the Jordan River westward into the Promised Land.<br/>All demons are part of the East.<br/>This is not true on the planet Venus, which rotates in the opposite direction from the Earth (retrograde rotation).<br/>In Saberhagen's Empire of the East series, the rival powers are West and East, including both humans and supernatural beings.<br/>In Tolkien's earlier work, the north had been the direction of evil.<br/>Ancient Egyptians also believed that the Goddess Amunet was a personification of the West.<br/>The concept of the Western part of the earth has its roots in the Western Roman Empire and the Western Christianity.<br/><br/><br/><strong>direction should the object</strong><strong>: </strong>For example, an object to the East would have an absolute bearing of 90 degrees.<br/>For example, an object relative bearing of 0 degrees would be dead ahead.<br/>an object relative bearing 180 degrees would be behind.<br/>A bearing can be taken to a fixed or moving object in order to target it with gunfire or missiles.<br/>Accordingly, the direction at A of B, expressed as a bearing, is not in general the opposite of the direction at B of A (when traveling on the great circle formed by A and B).<br/>Example: The navigator on a ship observes a lighthouse when its relative bearing is 45\u00b0 and again when it is 90\u00b0.<br/>25\u00b0 relative would be 'one point abaft the starboard beam' and an object at 213.<br/>Relative bearing refers to the angle between the craft's forward direction and the location of another object.<br/>See the end point on a map when you specify a start point, a bearing and a distance.<br/>He now knows that the distance from the ship to the lighthouse is equal to the distance travelled by the vessel between both observations.<br/><br/><br/><strong>ceiling fan</strong><strong>: </strong>Also, if one is carrying a long and awkward object, one end may inadvertently enter the path of rotation of a ceiling fan's blades, which can cause damage to the fan.<br/>A downrod, a metal pipe used to suspend the fan from the ceiling.<br/>A mechanism for mounting the fan to the ceiling such as:.<br/>A type of mounting system where the ceiling fan hangs on a hardened metal hook, screwed into the ceiling or bolted through a steel I-beam.<br/>This action works to even out the temperature in the room, making it cooler nearer the ceiling, but warmer nearer the floor.<br/>The direction that a fan spins should change based on whether the room needs to be heated or cooled.<br/>Contrary to popular misconception, wobbling alone will not cause a ceiling fan to fall.<br/>Some fans have their control(s) mounted on the wall instead of on the fans themselves.<br/>The fan can be mounted directly on a ceiling hook, making the junction box optional.<br/>In one position, the fan is caused to rotate clockwise, in the other position the fan is caused to rotate counter-clockwise.<br/><br/><br/><strong>overhead</strong><strong>: </strong>Normally the downward pull of the weights and the reactive upward pull of the tensioned wires lifts the pulley so its teeth are well clear of a stop on the mast.<br/>The pulley can turn freely while the weights move up or down as the wires contract or expand.<br/>With AT the continuous length of overhead line is limited due to the change in the height of the weights as the overhead line expands and contracts with temperature changes.<br/>As the pantograph moves along under the contact wire, the carbon insert on top of the pantograph becomes worn with time.<br/>It presses against the underside of the lowest overhead wire, the contact wire.<br/>This stops further rotation, limits the damage, and keeps the undamaged part of the wire intact until it can be repaired.<br/>This can result in poor electrical contact between the collector and the overhead line, resulting in electrical arcing and power surges.<br/>Problems with overhead equipment.<br/>Alternatively, section breaks can be sited at the crossing point, so that the crossing is electrically dead.<br/>To make the wire stronger, 0.<br/><br/><br/><strong>chair</strong><strong>: </strong>Hence in some chair designs, the armrest is not continuous to the chair back, but is missing in the elbow area.<br/>otherwise the occupant is too far away from the desk or table.<br/>The back of the chair will support some of the weight of the occupant, reducing the weight on other parts of the body.<br/>Center seats where a solid material forms the chair seat.<br/>All pages with titles containing the chair.<br/>Chair glides are attached to the feet of chairs to prevent them from scratching or snagging on the floor.<br/>This anthropometric measurement is used to determine the seat depth.<br/>By matching the shape of the occupant's buttocks, weight is distributed and maximum pressure is reduced.<br/>However, the person who is first chair in the first violin section is usually referred to as the concertmaster in the US or leader in the UK.<br/>Under these higher loads, the chair may be damaged, but it must not fail catastrophically.<br/><br/><br/><strong>south should the object</strong><strong>: </strong>Thus, the objects can be receivers of both love and hate, the affective effects of the libido and the death drive.<br/>Likewise, the infant who destroyed the bad object is not the infant who loves the good object.<br/>The introjection of the good object, first of all the mother\u2019s breast, is a precondition for normal development.<br/>In Kashmiri, the word order in embedded clauses is conditioned by the category of the subordinating conjunction, as in Example 3.<br/>Part objects are a function of splitting, which takes place in phantasy.<br/>Introjection of the good object is also used by the ego as a defense against anxiety.<br/>Internal objects are formed by the patterns in one's experience of being taken care of as a baby, which may or may not be accurate representations of the actual, external caretakers.<br/>Klein notes that in splitting the object, the ego is also split.<br/>\u201cBefore the depressive position, a good object is not in any way the same thing as a bad object.<br/>Freud originally identified people in a subject's environment with the term \"object\" to identify people as the object of drives.<br/><br/><br/><strong>furniture</strong><strong>: </strong>Methods for determination of stability of non-domestic storage furniture (British Standard).<br/>The geometric rosette accompanies the ogive many times, having a big variety of forms.<br/>Usually, the locks and escutcheon of chests have also an ornamental scope, being finely made.<br/>Strength and stability of furniture.<br/>It is likely that the style of furniture prevalent in late antiquity persisted throughout the middle ages.<br/>This will be evident to anyone who will visit, first the Palace of Versailles, then the Grand Trianon, and afterwards the Petit Trianon.<br/>He discovered the benefits of a waterbed for recuperation.<br/>The practice of using natural objects as rudimentary pieces of furniture likely dates to the beginning of human civilisation.<br/>The English usage, referring specifically to household objects, is specific to that language.<br/>Casters which make some furniture moveable.<br/><br/><br/><strong>carpet</strong><strong>: </strong>In fact, the circumstance in which the substance is viewed by the camera is still ambiguous.<br/>The exact nature of the substance that is deposited on Michael's carpet is never made clear.<br/>This happened when the fibres degraded over time and short strands broke away with contact or friction.<br/>Until the mid-18th century they were mostly used on walls and tables.<br/>With judicial and skilful planting of colours in the frames the number of colours could be increased to about twenty, enabling complex designs to be produced.<br/>The carpet is produced on a loom quite similar to woven fabric.<br/>There are new styles of carpet combining the two styles called cut and loop carpeting.<br/>Still, some show figures engaged either in the hunt or feasting scenes.<br/>Except in royal or ecclesiastical settings they were considered too precious to cover the floor.<br/>Historically, the term \"carpet\" was also applied to table and wall coverings, as carpets were not commonly used on the floor in European interiors until the 15th century.<br/><br/><br/><strong>north</strong><strong>: </strong>This means some objects, such as Uranus, rotate in the retrograde direction: when seen from the IAU north, the spin is clockwise.<br/>The visible rotation of the night sky around the visible celestial pole provides a vivid metaphor of that direction corresponding to \"up\".<br/>On any rotating astronomical object, north often denotes the side appearing to rotate counter-clockwise when viewed from afar along the axis of rotation.<br/>By convention, the top side of a map is often north.<br/>Similarly, the other cardinal directions are also related to the sun's position.<br/>The area Sektion 12 on the lower \"B-stand\" grew so popular that the fans in a dialogue with the club made it bigger.<br/>east and west would not be 180 degrees apart, but instead would differ from that by up to twice the degrees of latitude of the location in question, and.<br/>Maps tend to be drawn for viewing with either true north or magnetic north at the top.<br/>occasionally with a single arrow oriented to the map's representation of magnetic north, or two arrows oriented to true and magnetic north respectively,.<br/>usually with a single arrow oriented to the map's representation of true north,.<br/><br/><br/><strong>clockwise</strong><strong>: </strong>Then, when the Sun moves in the sky (from east to south to west), the shadow, which is cast on the sundial in the opposite direction, moves with the same sense of rotation (from west to north to east).<br/>Similarly, the flyer whorl of a spinning wheel uses a left-hand thread to keep it from loosening.<br/>This effect is caused by the plane of the dial having been rotated through the plane of the motion of the sun and thus the shadow is observed from the other side of the dial's plane and is observed as moving in the opposite direction.<br/>Curiously, unlike with games, there is usually no objection when the activity uncharacteristically begins in a counterclockwise motion.<br/>Typical nuts, screws, bolts, bottle caps, and jar lids are tightened (moved away from the observer) clockwise and loosened (moved towards the observer) counterclockwise in accordance with the right-hand rule.<br/>Two-dimensional rotation can occur in two possible directions.<br/>For bicycle pedals, the one on the left must be reverse-threaded to prevent it unscrewing during use.<br/>To apply the right-hand rule, place one's loosely clenched right hand above the object with the thumb pointing in the direction one wants the screw, nut, bolt, or cap ultimately to move, and the curl of the fingers, from the palm to the tips, will indicate in which way one needs to turn the screw, nut, bolt or cap to achieve the desired result.<br/>A turnbuckle has right-handed threads on one end and left-handed threads on the other.<br/>An alternative formulation with sin and cos swapped gives a clockwise trace from the upper-most

size of the bed.<br/>However, U-shaped pillows can sometimes force the head forward, creating neck stiffness.<br/>Travel pillows provide support for the neck in a sitting position.<br/>The main distinguishing feature is whether the pillow case is plain or with a valance around the edge.<br/>Often, a zippered pillow protector is often placed around standard pillows with the case in turn covering the protector.<br/>For example, unless a person has some particular medical condition, they will likely use a handy decorative pillow for lumbar support, as needed, while seated on a sofa.<br/>essentially a bag, with a flap in the open end to tuck the pillowcase behind to keep it in.<br/>This pillows have a separate flap of fabric that is attached at the top of the pillow and folds down over the face.<br/>In earlier eras, pillows would often break, shedding feathers throughout a room.<br/><br/><br/><strong>south</strong><strong>: </strong>This illustrates the effect the

Object.<br/>Equals method to ensure the object is compared using business logic.<br/>two value objects are equal when they have the same value, not necessarily being the same object.<br/>The Liskov substitution principle: \"objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.<br/>Value objects are among the building blocks of DDD.<br/>Make the class immutable by removing any property setters and only passing member values through the constructors.<br/>Value objects should be immutable: this is required for the implicit contract that two value objects created equal, should remain equal.<br/>It is also useful for value objects to be immutable, as client code cannot put the value object in an invalid state or introduce buggy behaviour after instantiation.<br/>GetHashCode method and ensure that the hash is same for the objects who have same equality.<br/>The following procedure can be carried out to add value object properties to a C# class:.<br/><br/><br/><strong>propeller</strong><strong>: </strong>Therefore, it is necessary for the blade to be twisted so as to maintain a uniform angle of attack over the whole of the blade.<br/>Generally, the propellers on both engines of most conventional twin-engined aircraft spin clockwise (as viewed from the rear of the aircraft).<br/>Often, the bushing can be drawn into place with nothing more complex than a couple of nuts, washers and a threaded rod.<br/>The force felt by the blades acting to pull them away from the hub when turning.<br/>instead they may fit a rope cutter that fits around the prop shaft and rotates with the propeller.<br/>Also, the rubber bushing may perish over time leading to its failure under loads below its designed failure load.<br/>However, 'lift-and-drag' is only one way to express the aerodynamic force on the blades.<br/>The pressure on the upstream surface of the blade (the \"suction side\") can drop below the vapor pressure of the water, resulting in the formation of a vapor pocket.<br/>The transverse view shows the transverse projection of a blade and the developed outline of the blade.<br/>Forces acting on a propeller.<br/><br/><br/><strong>overhead should the object</strong><strong>: </strong>Due to the mirroring of the image in the head of the overhead projector, the image on the wall is \"re-flipped\" to where it would be if one was looking at the LCD screen normally.<br/>The result is different from the result a shallow copy gives in that the objects referenced by the copy B are distinct from those referenced by A, and independent.<br/>However, because the lamp was suspended above and outside the reflector, a large amount of light was cast to the sides inside the projector body that was wasted, thus requiring a higher power lamp for sufficient screen illumination.<br/>This has the greatest effect towards the outer edges of the projected image, so that one typically sees either blue or brown fringing at the edge of the screen when the focus is towards an extreme.<br/>With a change in the projection distance, the focusing must be readjusted for a sharp image.<br/>Next, it is reflected horizontally to the screen.<br/>This, coupled with a wide angle lens and an overhead reflector, directs the light vertically upward through the stage.<br/>Second, because the type is generic, the compiler ensures that the destination object and the source object have the same type.<br/>copy performs shallow copying of an object.<br/>501 Ways to Use the Overhead

waveguide change the characteristic impedance and frequency, degrading the signal.<br/>The differences in particle size dictate if the silica gel should be used for flash or gravity chromatography.<br/>Additionally, the gel acts as a processing aid when the cable is being constructed, keeping the fibers central whilst the tube material is extruded around it.<br/>However, material silica gel removes moisture by adsorption onto the surface of its numerous pores rather than by absorption into the bulk of the gel.<br/>Once saturated with water, the gel can be regenerated by heating it to 120 \u00b0C (250 \u00b0F) for 1\u20132 hours.<br/>It is common for a small compressed air system (similar to a small home aquarium pump) to be employed to circulate the air inside the waveguide over a jar of silica gel.<br/>Note 1: The network component of a hydrogel is usually a polymer network.<br/>Because of the inherent cross-links, the structural integrity of the hydrogel

to physical couches in the casting office, but is now a metonym for the phenomenon as a whole.<br/>Although a couch is used primarily for seating, it may be used for sleeping.<br/>Sectional sofas are used to wrap around walls or other furniture.<br/>It is commonly found in the form of a bench, with upholstered armrests, and often fitted with springs and tailored cushions.<br/>The loveseat is designed for seating two people, while the sofa has more than two cushion seats.<br/>Couch is predominantly used in North America, South Africa, Australia and Ireland, whereas the terms sofa and settee (U and non-U) are most commonly used in the United Kingdom and India.<br/>An actor's decision of whether to provide sex is comparable to the prisoner's dilemma, and results in a tragedy of the

hardened metal hook, screwed into the ceiling or bolted through a steel I-beam.<br/>This action works to even out the temperature in the room, making it cooler nearer the ceiling, but warmer nearer the floor.<br/>The direction that a fan spins should change based on whether the room needs to be heated or cooled.<br/>Contrary to popular misconception, wobbling alone will not cause a ceiling fan to fall.<br/>Some fans have their control(s) mounted on the wall instead of on the fans themselves.<br/>The fan can be mounted directly on a ceiling hook, making the junction box optional.<br/>In one

train is a local trash train, D765, that runs between the Maryland towns of Derwood and Dickerson.<br/>The Industrial Revolution in the 19th century saw a number of inventions fundamentally change transport.<br/>Early water transport was accomplished with ships that were either rowed or used the wind for propulsion, or a combination of the two.<br/>In the 1950s the introduction of containerization gave massive efficiency gains in freight transport, fostering globalization.<br/>Most such transport infrastructure came under government control in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, culminating in the nationalization of inter-city passenger rail-service with the establishment of Amtrak.<br/>While all modes of transport are used for cargo transport, there is high differentiation between the nature of the cargo transport, in which mode is chosen.<br/>Another group of projects are the \"heavy\" units.<br/>The 19th century also saw the development of the steam ship, which sped up global transport.<br/><br/><br/><strong>1800's</strong><strong>: </strong>The man behind the project was an engineering consultant to Volvo, Helmer Petterson, who in the 1940s was

corresponding purpose-built \"railways\" are monorails, high-speed railways, maglev, atmospheric railways, rubber-tired underground, funicular and cog railways.<br/>An alternative type of \"intermodal\" vehicle, known as a roadrailer, is designed to be physically attached to the train.<br/>One notable and growing long-distance train category is high-speed rail, which generally runs at speeds above 200 km/h (120 mph) and often operates on dedicated track that is surveyed and prepared to accommodate high speeds.<br/>Trains are a very efficient mode of transport to cope with large traffic demand in a metropolis.<br/>There are various types of trains that are designed for particular purposes.<br/>There are simple types of open-topped wagons for transporting minerals and bulk material such as coal, and tankers for transporting liquids and gases.<br/>A developing technology is fuel cells, which combine the advantage of not needing an electrical system in place, with the advantage of emissionless operation.<br/>The first successful example of a high-speed passenger rail system was Japan's Shinkansen, colloquially known as the \"bullet train\", which commenced operation in October 1964.<br/>One of the most common types on modern railways are intermodal (container) trains, where the containers can be lifted on and off the train by cranes and loaded off or

issue.<br/><br/><br/><strong>diesel source</strong><strong>: </strong>diesel engines are simply compression-ignition engines, and can operate on a variety of different fuels, depending on configuration and location.<br/>A diesel compression-ignition engine is usually designed to run on diesel fuel, but some types are adapted for other liquid fuels or natural gas.<br/>Diesel engines can work with the full spectrum of crude oil distillates, from natural gas, alcohols, gasoline, wood gas to the fuel oils from diesel oil to cheaper residual fuels that are like lard at room temperature, and must be heated to enable them to flow down a fuel line.<br/>The total capacity of reliably operable standby generation in Britain is estimated to be around 20 GW, nearly all of which is driven by diesel engines.<br/>Larger engines (from about 3 MWe to 30 MWe) sometimes use heavy oils, essentially tars, derived from the end of the refining process.<br/>This is implemented by introducing gas with the intake air and using a small amount of diesel fuel for ignition.<br/>In more rural situations, or for low load factor plant, diesel fuel derived from crude oil is a common fuel.<br/>Such a diesel-electric arrangement is also used in some very large land vehicles such as railroad locomotives.<br/>A diesel generator will take more load when the fuel supply to its combustion system is increased, while load is released if fuel supply is decreased.<br/>An islanded power plant intended for primary power source of an isolated community will often have at least three diesel generators, any two of which are rated to carry the required load.<br/><br/><br/><strong>bus source</strong><strong>: </strong>Early buses, known as trolleybuses, were powered by electricity supplied from

are kerosene-based.<br/>Deriving \"drop-in\" jet fuel from bio-based sources is ASTM approved via two routes.<br/><br/><br/><strong>land vehicle</strong><strong>: </strong>Most land vehicles rely on friction for accelerating, decelerating and changing direction.<br/>Most vehicles, with the notable exception of railed vehicles, have at least one steering mechanism.<br/>Ion thrusters run primarily off electricity, but they also need a propellant such as caesium, or more recently xenon.<br/>Many pedalo boats also use paddle wheels for propulsion.<br/>Most motor vehicles have internal combustion engines.<br/>It is essential that a vehicle have a source of energy to drive it.<br/>Compressed gas motors have been used on some vehicles experimentally.<br/>Similarly to propeller vehicles, some vehicles use wings for propulsion.<br/>The largest vehicle in the world, the Bagger 288, is propelled by continuous tracks.<br/>Screw-propelled vehicles are propelled by auger-like cylinders fitted with helical flanges.<br/><br/><br/><strong>fuel source</strong><strong>: </strong>These engines require clean-burning fuels.<br/>Most transportation fuels are liquids, because vehicles usually require high energy density.<br/>Other forms of transportation, railways and aircraft, also require fossil fuels.<br/>The streets of Baghdad were paved with tar, derived from petroleum that became accessible from natural fields in the region.<br/>Biofuel can be produced from any carbon source that can be replenished rapidly e.<br/>Most liquid fuels in widespread use are derived from the fossilized remains of dead plants and animals by exposure to heat and pressure inside the Earth's crust.<br/>Nuclear fuel has the highest energy density of all practical fuel sources.<br/>The most

depended on natural fractures through which gas flowed.<br/>Most grid peaking power plants and some off-grid engine-generators use natural gas.<br/>Gasoline/petrol vehicles converted to run on natural gas suffer because of the low compression ratio of their engines, resulting in a cropping of delivered power while running on natural gas (10\u201315%).<br/>Another 22 deaths were attributed to appliances running on liquified petroleum gas, and 17 deaths on gas of unspecified type.<br/>Gas tungsten arc welding uses a constant current power source, meaning that the current (and thus the heat flux) remains relatively constant, even if the arc distance and voltage change.<br/>Domestic appliances, furnaces, and boilers use low pressure, usually 6 to 7 inches of water (6\" to 7\" WC), which is about 0.<br/>Particularly high efficiencies can be achieved through combining gas turbines with a steam turbine in combined cycle mode.<br/>Typically, natural gas powered engines require 950\u20131,050 BTU/cu ft (35\u201339 MJ/m3) natural gas to operate at the rotational name plate specifications.<br/>Some jurisdictions, such as Saskatchewan, sell gas by volume only.<br/><br/><br/><strong>jet fuel</strong><strong>: </strong>Commonly aircraft are propelled by airbreathing jet engines.<br/>The engine needs compressed air for itself just to run successfully.<br/>Jet fuel is often used in diesel-powered ground-support vehicles at airports.<br/>Industrial gas turbines can create up to 50,000 shaft horsepower.<br/>The compressor is powered by the turbine, which extracts energy from the expanding gas passing through it.<br/>A few air-breathing engines made for high speed applications (ramjets and scramjets) use the ram effect of the vehicle's speed instead of a mechanical compressor.<br/>Most modern subsonic jet aircraft use more complex high-bypass turbofan engines.<br/>Jet aircraft use such engines for long-distance travel.<br/>There are many different variations of gas turbines, but they all use a gas generator system of some type.<br/>As a result, a few aircraft engine manufacturers, most notably Thielert and

are also called trackless trolleys, but are built on the same platforms as a typical diesel, CNG, or hybrid bus.<br/>Some historical forms of public transport include the stagecoach, traveling a fixed route between coaching inns, and the horse-drawn boat carrying paying passengers, which was a feature of European canals from their 17th-century origins.<br/>Once built, the infrastructure will require operating and maintenance costs, adding to the total cost of public transport.<br/>Trackless train.<br/>High-speed rail networks are being developed in many parts of the world.<br/>Many, if

UK.<br/>Notable train drivers.<br/>In American English, a hostler moves engines around train yards, but does not take them out on the normal tracks.<br/>The driver is in charge of, and responsible for operating the engine, as well as the mechanical operation of the train, train speed, and all train handling.<br/>How to become a train driver guide.<br/>The Center Of A Future Train Conductor.<br/>The United Kingdom based transport historian Christian Wolmar stated in October 2013 that train operators employed by the Rio Tinto Group to transport iron ore across the Australian outback were likely to be the highest-paid members of the occupation in the world at that time.<br/>In India, a driver starts as a diesel assistant (or electrical assistant for electric locomotives).<br/>A train driver, engine driver or locomotive driver, commonly known as an engineer in the United States and Canada, and also as a locomotive handler, locomotive operator, train operator, or motorman, is a person who drives a train.<br/>For many American railroads, the following career progression is typical: assistant conductor (brakeman), train conductor and finally the engineer.<br/><br/><br/><strong>name</strong><strong>: </strong>Today, this style of name is still used in Jewish religious rites.<br/>The name Mohammed and Ahmed are same, for example Suhel Ahmad or Mohammad Suhel are same.<br/>Sometimes there is a name for the car's \"decoration level\" or \"trim line\" as well: e.<br/>Kate Monk's Onomastikon Names over the world throughout the history.<br/>In the Old Testament, the names of individuals are meaningful, and a change of name indicates a change of status.<br/>We can see many Arabic names in the Quran and in Muslim people.<br/>The Name Tradition In The Christian Culture.<br/>In certain African cultures, such as in Cameroon, the eldest son gets the family name for his given name.<br/>For some Indians, their birth name is different from their official name.<br/>They can identify a class or category of things, or a single thing, either uniquely, or within a given context.<br/><br/><br/><strong>train</strong><strong>: </strong>The railway terminology that is used to describe a train varies between countries.<br/>Almost all monorail trains use linear induction motors.<br/>\"Piggy-back\" trains are the fastest growing type of freight train in the US, where they are also known as \"trailer on flatcar\" or TOFC trains.<br/>Double deck high speed and sleeper trains are becoming more common in mainland Europe.<br/>Special kinds of train running on corresponding purpose-built \"railways\" are monorails, high-speed railways, maglev, atmospheric railways, rubber-tired underground, funicular and cog railways.<br/>Sometimes extreme congestion of commuter trains can become a problem.<br/>There are various types of trains that are designed for particular purposes.<br/>While when referring to a train made up of a variety of vehicles, or of several sets/units, the term formation is used.<br/>Many prestigious passenger train services have been bestowed a special name, some of which have become famous in literature and fiction.<br/>A less common practice is the naming of freight trains, for the same commercial reasons.<br/><br/><br/><strong>transport</strong><strong>: </strong>Also, a train can be powered by horses, cables, gravity, pneumatics and gas turbines.<br/>Some long-haul trains have been given a specific name.<br/>A multiple unit has powered wheels throughout the whole train.<br/>The inspection of railway equipment is essential for the safe movement of trains.<br/>Following his patent, Watt's employee William Murdoch produced a working model of a self-propelled steam carriage in that year.<br/>Many types of defect detectors are in use on the world's railroads.<br/>Most forms of train control involve movement authority being passed from those responsible for each section of a rail network to the train crew.<br/>Thus the railway system in Great Britain is the oldest in the world.<br/>Freight trains are very efficient, with economy of scale and high energy efficiency.<br/>Passenger trains.<br/><br/><br/><strong>atl\u00e9tico nacional</strong><strong>: </strong>The colors of the team are derived from the flags of the Antioquia Department and the city of Medell\u00edn.<br/>The club was created to promote sports in the city, especially football and basketball.<br/>The involvement of Pablo Escobar in the club remained strong.<br/>The stadium is shared with Independiente Medell\u00edn, rival of the team.<br/>The first match was played in Curitiba.<br/>People saw our situation and said Pablo was involved.<br/>However, the team had to play its home matches in Chile.<br/>Evolution of Atl\u00e9tico Nacional's badge.<br/>Currently both teams are considered among the top teams in Colombia.<br/>the white variety is the most common in the region, giving the color scheme to the team.<br/><br/><br/><strong>electric locomotive</strong><strong>: </strong>The first electric passenger train was presented by Werner von Siemens at Berlin in 1879.<br/>the failure of this single unit temporarily disables the train.<br/>The upper half depicts the ES 64 U \"Taurus\", a high performance locomotive from the turn of the 21st century.<br/>Also, the latest Russian passenger locomotive EP10 is dual-system.<br/>Maximum utilization of power cars.<br/>The distinguishing design features of electric locomotives are:.<br/>The type of service in which the locomotive is used dictates the gear ratio employed.<br/>The type of electrical power used, AC or DC.<br/>The obverse shows two locomotives: one historic and one modern, representing the technical development in locomotive construction between the years 1854 and 2004.<br/>One example is the 25 Euro 150 Years Semmering Alpine Railway commemorative

made without gluten.<br/>Breakfast and pizza items are only available in some stores.<br/>The report also showed the boxes designed to store these sandwiches were 2 feet 10.<br/>The first Subway on the West Coast was opened in Fresno, California, in 1978.<br/>Also in 2016, Subway announced a new logo for the franchise, to be implemented in 2017.<br/>All pages with titles containing Subway.<br/>Subway responded by saying, \"With regards to the size of the bread and calling it a footlong, 'Subway Footlong' is a registered trademark as a descriptive name for the sub sold in Subway Restaurants and not intended to be a measurement of length.<br/>to oversee operations of the restaurants as the franchise expanded.<br/>Subway made alterations to its bread after food blogger and activist Vani Hari gathered more than 50,000 signatures in a petition drive.<br/><br/><br/><strong>longcroft school</strong><strong>: </strong>The facilities available at the school are used by many community groups and organisations during evenings, at weekends and during school holidays.<br/>Over the choir's period of existence, the choir has performed at venues such as Disneyland Paris and the Apple Store on Oxford Street, London, have released two of their own albums and have featured on a track by singer songwriter Henry Priestman.<br/>Founded and directed by Jonathan Chapman, the Longcroft Gospel Choir is well known in the local area, and regularly performs at parties, ceremonies, weddings and music concerts.<br/>In 2001 it was accredited with the specialist status of a Performing Arts College (re-accredited in 2006 and 2009), which brought with it the funds to increase class-room space, develop a fully working theatre in the school hall and extend links to the wider community and feeder primary schools.<br/>The site is over 50 acres and includes open spaces for sporting activities.<br/>The choir comprises students from Year 9 and above and has a large repertoire of music.<br/>People with the surname.<br/>In more recent years, Longcroft acquired funding from the East Riding of Yorkshire Council and the Football Foundation to build a new sports hall and all-weather pitch.<br/>External links.<br/>The school changed its name to Longcroft School at some time between 2009 and 2012, as it was no longer a Performing Arts College.<br/><br/><br/><strong>sign</strong><strong>: </strong>Why it was used in this context is still a mystery.<br/>The evolution of the symbol as used today is not recorded.<br/>The Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola disapproves of this usage.<br/>Currently, the word arroba means both the at-symbol and a unit of weight.<br/>Commonly, people will call the symbol [\u00e6t] (as in English), particularly when giving their email addresses.<br/>This naming is because the at sign was used to represent this measure.<br/>Note that the Croatian words for monkey, majmun, opica, jopec, \u0161imija are not used to denote the symbol, except seldom the latter words regionally.<br/>In mathematics, the sign of a number tells whether it is positive or negative.<br/>Also, the sign of a permutation tells whether it is the product of an even or odd number of transpositions.<br/>Naming the symbol after animals is also common.<br/><br/><br/><strong>amtrack</strong><strong>: </strong>all cities listed are

transport are used for cargo transport, there is high differentiation between the nature of the cargo transport, in which mode is chosen.<br/>The most common road vehicle in the developed world is the automobile, a wheeled passenger vehicle that carries its own motor.<br/>Each mode of transport has a fundamentally different technological solution, and some require a separate environment.<br/>For liquids/gases, any chemically stable liquid or gas can be sent through a pipeline.<br/>But the infrastructure and operation of transport have a great impact on the land, and transport is the largest drainer of energy, making transport sustainability a major issue.<br/>even the air can be entered with human-powered aircraft.<br/><br/><br/><strong>red train</strong><strong>: </strong>The Red Arrow is the most popular train in Russia.<br/>In 1962, the deep red colour of the train was adopted.<br/>As of June 2010 the subway train has been repaired and relaunched.<br/>In honour of the 75th anniversary of the train, a special subway train called Red Arrow - 75 Years was launched in 2006 on the Moscow Metro.<br/>As the demand for sleeper train increased even more, a private sleeper train, called Megapolis, was introduced by the Tverskoy Express company, leaving Moscow or St Petersburg after the Red Arrow and Express.<br/>To enhance capacity, a second sleeper train was introduced in 1978, called the Red Arrow 2.<br/>However in practice the main train started and terminated at Swansea with only a through portion working west of there to Carmarthen.<br/>As newly designed cars were introduced by Russian Railways in 2007, the Red Arrow 2 was renamed Express.<br/>In designing the interior of the compartment cars, mainly wood is used.<br/>On 29 March 2010 the subway train was bombed in the terrorist attack at Lubyanka station.<br/><br/><br/><strong>the model</strong><strong>: </strong>The interactions between all the particles described by the Standard Model are summarized

instead of Sundays.<br/>The train's maximum speed will depend on how many blocks are open in front of it.<br/>Some rapid transport trains have extra features such as wall sockets and internet connectivity.<br/>Current official transit maps of the New York City Subway are based on a 1979 design by Michael Hertz Associates.<br/>Based on the line number, for example Sinyongsan station, coded as station 429.<br/>for example, they show the interchange stations where passengers can transfer between lines.<br/>Advocates of this system note that it is much quieter than conventional steel-wheeled trains, and allows for greater inclines given the increased traction of the rubber tires.<br/>For instance, in 2010, one R142A train set on the 6 route was wrapped with a Target advertisement.<br/>Continuously welded rail, which is also being installed, reduces the noise being made by the wheels of trains.<br/><br/><br/><strong>commuter train</strong><strong>:

"<strong>the first board</strong><strong>: </strong>The earliest board games published in the United States were based upon Christian morality.<br/>The first complete set of this game was discovered from a Theban tomb that dates to the 13th Dynasty.<br/>Abbott's wife recalled him performing the routine with another comedian before teaming with Costello.<br/>One of the first such games, The Game of the District Messenger Boy, encouraged the idea that the lowliest messenger boy could ascend the corporate ladder to its topmost rung.<br/>Early board game producers in the second half of the eighteenth century were mapmakers.<br/>The use of dice of various sorts goes back to the earliest board games.<br/>By 1944, Abbott and Costello had the routine copyrighted.<br/>Other games use spinners, timers of random length, or other sources of randomness.<br/>Advances in papermaking and printmaking during the period enabled the commercial production of relatively inexpensive board games.<br/>The game was the first to focus on secular virtues rather than religious virtues, and sold 40,000 copies its first year.<br/><br/><br/><strong>black paddle</strong><strong>: </strong>In 1704,  French physicist Denis Papin constructed the first ship powered by his steam engine, mechanically linked to paddles.<br/>In 1787, Patrick Miller of Dalswinton invented a double-hulled boat that was propelled on the Firth of Forth by men working a capstan that drove paddles on each side.<br/>Although the first stern-wheelers were invented in Europe, they saw the most service in North America, especially on the Mississippi River.<br/>Then, he  poured the first steam cylinder of the world in the iron foundry at Veckerhagen.<br/>The concept was improved by the Italian Roberto Valturio in 1463, who devised a boat with five sets, where the parallel cranks are all joined to a single power source by one connecting rod, an idea adopted by his compatriot Francesco di Giorgio.<br/>The first stern-wheeler was built by Mr.<br/>This made him the first to construct a steam-powered boat (or vehicle of any kind).<br/>This was the first powered crossing of the Atlantic, although Savannah was built as a sailing ship with a steam auxiliary.<br/>It successfully hauled two 70-ton barges almost 20 mi (32 km) in 6 hours against a strong headwind on test in 1802.<br/>Beaver was the first coastal steamship to operate in the Pacific Northwest of North America.<br/><br/><br/><strong>burton</strong><strong>: </strong>Depp wrote a similar comment in the foreword to Mark Salisbury's book, Burton on Burton, regarding his first meeting with Burton over the casting of the film.<br/>Burton's idea for the character of Edward Scissorhands came from a drawing he created in high school.<br/>Burton convinced Disney to drop the idea.<br/>It's the first comic I've ever loved.<br/>Burton directed his first music video, \"Bones\", in 2006.<br/>Burton was originally supposed to direct the film after seeing Elliott perform on Get a Life, but he handed the directing responsibility to Resnick once he was offered Ed Wood.<br/>Over 100 people worked on this motion picture just to create the characters, and it took three years of work to produce the film.<br/>Bourton (disambiguation).<br/>Burton's ability to produce hits with low budgets impressed studio executives, and he received his first big budget film, Batman.<br/>Christopher Lee, one of Hammer's stars, was given a cameo role.<br/><br/><br/><strong>surfboard</strong><strong>: </strong>Firewire Surfboards pioneered this technology for the mass-produced surfboard market beginning in 2006.<br/>Longboards are the original and very first variety of board used in standup surfing.<br/>Eventually, surfing made its way to the slopes with the invention of the Snurfer, later credited as the first snowboard.<br/>The American surfer Tom Blake was the first to experiment with adding a fin to a surfboard, fastening the keel from an old speedboat to a surfboard in 1935.<br/>Jim Richardson, 25-year veteran shaper on the North Shore of Oahu, first pioneered this technology in the mid 1990s.<br/>Longboards are more suitable for beginners because of the board's size and ease of catching waves.<br/>He created a prototype and 30 years later his \"thruster\" design is still the most popular fin design for surfboards.<br/>It was in Hawaii that the art of standing and surfing upright on boards was invented.<br/>The first stand up surfboard ridden in Australia by Duke Kahanamoku and Isabel Letham is an oversized longboard with enough volume to support two people, tandem surfing.<br/>George Freeth decided to revive the art of surfing, but had little success with the huge 500 cm (16 ft) hardwood boards that were popular at that time.<br/><br/><br/><strong>laird hamilton</strong><strong>: </strong>Hamilton has also experimented with the foilboard, an innovative surfboard which incorporates hydrofoil technology allowing a higher degree of precision and effectiveness of aerial techniques within the water.<br/>Kalama is credited with the co-development of the big wave surfing technique of tow-in surfing, along with Laird Hamilton, Darrick Doerner, and Buzzy Kerbox.<br/>An early attempt at media recognition was his quest to be the first surfer to complete a 360 degree loop while strapped to his board.<br/>Kalama and Hamilton are also credited with the co-development of \"foil surfing\" (hydrofoil surfing).<br/>This innovation is chronicled in the documentary film, Riding Giants.<br/>Laird Hamilton, along with Paul Hodge and Gabrielle Reece co founded Laird Superfood in 2015.<br/>A still photograph of him riding the wave made the cover of Surfer magazine, with the caption: \"oh my

a statue by Virgil Cantini.<br/>Anthropology has shown that masculinity itself has social status, just like wealth, race and social class.<br/>The Parsons model was used to contrast and illustrate extreme positions on gender roles.<br/>In Western culture, for example, greater masculinity usually brings greater social status.<br/>Another significant hormone in sexual differentiation is the anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone, which inhibits the development of the M\u00fcllerian ducts.<br/>A voice that is significantly deeper than the voice of a child or a woman.<br/>In all cultures in the past, and still among traditional and non-Western cultures, getting married is the most common and definitive distinction between boyhood and manhood.<br/>\"Man\", a 1988 song on the album Staring at the

referred to the masks worn by actors on stage.<br/><br/><br/><strong>surfer</strong><strong>: </strong>The Surfer's board is composed of a nearly impervious, cosmically powered silvery material similar to his own skin.<br/>Eventually, surfing made its way to the slopes with the invention of the Snurfer, later credited as the first snowboard.<br/>It was in Hawaii that the art of standing and surfing upright on boards was invented.<br/>George Freeth decided to revive the art of surfing, but had little success with the huge 500 cm (16 ft) hardwood boards that were popular at that time.<br/>When he cut them in half to make them more manageable, he created the original \"Long board\", which made him the talk of the islands.<br/>The board is nearly indestructible, but on the rare occasions it has been damaged or destroyed, the Surfer can repair or recreate it with little effort.<br/>Longer boards are good for beginners who need help balancing.<br/>Surfboards were originally made of solid wood and were large and heavy (often up to 370 cm (12 ft) long and having a mass of 70 kg (150 lb)).<br/>Modern longboards, generally 270 to 300 cm (9 to 10 ft) in length, are reminiscent of the earliest surfboards, but now benefit from modern innovations in surfboard shaping and fin design.<br/>Floater: Suspending the board atop the

developed.<br/><br/><br/><strong>tom blake</strong><strong>: </strong>He built the first aluminum \u201ctorpedo\u201d rescue buoy, basing it on the steel buoy created by California lifeguard Harry Walters in  1919.<br/>Then after three years of experimenting, in 1929, Blake constructed a hollow board with transverse bracing.<br/>he was the first to build a waterproof camera housing and inaugurated the tradition of surfers documenting themselves and their friends.<br/>He personally innovated most of what's associated with surfers to this day: he was the first to experiment with making better surfboards, revolutionizing board design in the process with lightweight materials and the fin.<br/>He then began his own experiments in improving surfboard design.<br/>Blake\u2019s inventions and innovations were not limited to surfboards.<br/>Blake first attempted to ride a wave in 1921 on an old board he found while working at the Santa Monica Swim Club.<br/>Ladder Company produced them for sale.<br/>\"In the early 1930s, Blake experimented with the idea of attaching a sail to one of his surfboards.<br/>In 1932, Blake, with two friends, made the first successful attempt

</strong>The texture of Cuban fufu is similar to the mofongo consumed in Puerto Rico, but it is not formed into a ball or fried.<br/>the result has a sweeter taste and a characteristic pleasant smell.<br/>The chips are typically labeled \"plantain chips\" when they are made of green plantains that taste starchy, like potato chips.<br/>The trunk and leaves are dark blue-green in color.<br/>The flesh is white and starchy, making it ideal for cooking.<br/>the pulp is softer than in immature, green fruit and some of the starch has been converted to sugar.<br/>The Philippine version uses chunks of saba bananas.<br/>The dark red inflorescence of saba (banana hearts, locally known in the Philippines as puso ng saba) are edible.<br/>An alternative way of cooking in Kerala is to boil or steam the banana, which is also at times filled with grated coconut, cardamon powder and sugar/jaggery and then sauteed in ghee.<br/>They are always cooked or fried when eaten green.<br/><br/><br/><strong>banana family</strong><strong>: </strong>The primary component of the aroma of fresh bananas is isoamyl acetate (also known as banana oil), which, along with several other compounds such as butyl acetate and isobutyl acetate, is a significant contributor to banana flavor.<br/>Most of these dishes use the Saba Banana or Cardaba banana cultivar.<br/>The flavor resembles that of artichoke.<br/>The Chinese name of the aromatic Go San Heong banana means 'You can smell it from the next mountain.<br/>The leaves of banana plants are composed of a \"stalk\" (petiole) and a blade (lamina).<br/>The tender core of the banana plant's trunk is also used in South Asian and Southeast Asian cuisine.<br/>Among other things, ethylene stimulates the formation of amylase, an enzyme that breaks down starch into sugar, influencing the taste of bananas.<br/>Banana chips are a snack produced from sliced dehydrated or fried banana or plantain, which have a dark brown color and an intense banana taste.<br/>The scientific names of most cultivated bananas are Musa acuminata, Musa balbisiana, and Musa \u00d7 paradisiaca for the hybrid Musa acuminata \u00d7 M.<br/>On the other hand, yellow bananas taste sweeter due to higher sugar concentrations.<br/><br/><br/><strong>fruit</strong><strong>: </strong>The part of the fruit that is used (eaten) is the pulpy juicy seeds.<br/>The shell of the coconut fruit is used to make bird houses, bowls, cups, musical instruments, and souvenir heads.<br/>Some or all of the edible part of accessory fruit is not generated by the ovary.<br/>The fruits have a juicy edible center composed of a large number of seeds.<br/>An example of this type of fruit fly is the Queensland fruit fly (Bactrocera tyroni) B.<br/>In other cases, the sepals, petals and/or stamens and style of the flower fall off.<br/>Osage orange fruits are used to repel cockroaches.<br/>Thus, these fruit flies cause significant damage to fruit crops.<br/>Commercial cultivars of bananas and pineapples are examples of seedless fruits.<br/>However, the fruit wall is very thin and is fused to the seed coat, so almost all of the edible grain is actually a seed.<br/><br/><br/><strong>green</strong><strong>: </strong>The flag of Hamas, as well as the flag of Iran, is green, symbolizing their Islamist ideology.<br/>The sensitivity of the dark-adapted human eye is greatest at about 507 nm, a blue-green color, while the light-adapted eye is most sensitive about 555 nm, a yellow-green.<br/>A green tinge in the skin is sometimes associated with nausea and sickness.<br/>Many flags of the Islamic world are green, as the color is considered sacred in Islam (see below).<br/>The efficiency of these lasers (peak 3%) compared to that of DPSS green lasers (peak 35%) may also be limiting adoption of the diodes to niche uses.<br/>There is no natural source for green food colorings which has been approved by the US Food and Drug

benevolent.<br/>Several minerals have a green color, including the emerald, which is colored green by its chromium content.<br/>This can causes their feces to look green as well.<br/><br/><br/><strong>over ripe</strong><strong>: </strong>Early in the ripening process these tannins are very bitter and \"green\".<br/>The color of the grape berries begin to change due to the building up of phenolic compounds such as anthocyanin in the skins.<br/>The concentration of phenolic compounds in the skin, most notably anthocyanins for red wine grapes, replace the green color of chlorophyll as the grape berries themselves change color.<br/>If the seeds are still green, the tannins inside the grape are more likely to be harsh and bitter.<br/>A sizable amount of research has gone into studying methods to determine the presence of flavor precursors and glycosides in the ripening grapes.<br/>With their high acidity and low sugar levels, these grapes would be under ripe and would produce table wines that many wine drinkers would consider unpalatable yet the balance of sugars and acids is well suited for sparkling wine production.<br/>The mineral components of potassium, calcium, magnesium and sodium increase in concentration as they are disseminated among the skin of the grapes and its fleshy pulp.<br/>The style of wine is usually dictated by the balance between sugars and acids.<br/>There are several factors that contribute to the ripeness of the grape.<br/>The decrease in free acids, as well as the buildup of potassium, triggers a rise in the pH level of the grape juice.<br/><br/><br/><strong>banana</strong><strong>: </strong>The primary component of the aroma of fresh bananas is isoamyl acetate (also known as banana oil), which, along with several

M.<br/>On the other hand, yellow bananas taste sweeter due to higher sugar concentrations.<br/><br/><br/><strong>sweet</strong><strong>: </strong>Some of the amino acids are mildly sweet: alanine, glycine, and serine are the sweetest.<br/>The color of food can affect sweetness perception.<br/>Sweet tastes are generally regarded as pleasurable, except when in excess.<br/>Sweetness is a basic taste most commonly perceived when eating foods rich in sugars.<br/>A few substances alter the way sweet taste is perceived.<br/>While curculin has some innate sweet taste of its own, miraculin is by itself quite tasteless.<br/>Hen egg lysozyme, an antibiotic protein found in chicken eggs, is also sweet.<br/>The sweetness of 20% solution of glycine in water compares to a solution of 10% glucose or 5% fructose.<br/>One class of these inhibits the perception of sweet tastes, whether from sugars or from highly potent sweeteners.<br/>The most potent of these, lugduname, is about 225,000 times sweeter than sucrose.<br/><br/><br/><strong>yellow banana</strong><strong>: </strong>The primary component of the aroma of fresh bananas is isoamyl acetate (also known as banana oil), which, along

relative ratios of sugars and acids, whereas orange aroma derives from volatile organic compounds, including alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, terpenes, and esters.<br/>the color of its juice is darker than that of the competing Hamlin.<br/>The juiciness of the orange.<br/>The fruit of the orange tree can be eaten fresh, or processed for its juice or fragrant peel.<br/>The majority of this crop is used mostly for juice extraction.<br/>When unripe, the fruit is green.<br/>The blood orange, with its distinct color and flavor, is generally considered favorably as a juice, and has found a niche as an ingredient variation in traditional Seville marmalade.<br/>Zest is popular in cooking because it contains oils and has a strong flavor similar to that of the orange pulp.<br/>The outermost layer of the rind can be thinly grated with a zester to produce orange zest.<br/>the fruit production and quality are similar to those of the Hamlin, but the juice has a deeper color.<br/><br/><br/><strong>potassium</strong><strong>: </strong>The potassium content of most plants ranges from 0.<br/>The activity of natural potassium is 31 Bq/g.<br/>The crystal structure of potassium chloride is like that of NaCl.<br/>The solid dissolves readily in water, and its solutions have a salt-like taste.<br/>The combined bitterness and saltiness of high-potassium solutions makes high-dose potassium supplementation by liquid drinks a palatability challenge.<br/>The addition of 1 ppm of thaumatin considerably reduces this bitterness.<br/>The reaction of potassium with water can be violently exothermic, especially since the coproduced hydrogen gas can ignite.<br/>The potassium concentration in seawater is 0.<br/>Complaints of bitterness or a chemical or metallic taste are also reported with potassium chloride used in food.<br/>The LD50 of orally ingested potassium chloride is approximately 2.<br/><br/><br/><strong>the taste</strong><strong>: </strong>The distinctive taste of chalk has been identified as the calcium component of that substance.<br/>while the actual taste of fatty acids is not pleasant.<br/>The taste thresholds of other bitter substances are rated relative to quinine, which is thus given a reference index of 1.<br/>These two substances taste bitter to some people, but are virtually tasteless to others.<br/>Fermented foods, such as wine, vinegar or yogurt, may have sour taste.<br/>The ethanol in alcoholic beverages tastes bitter, as do the additional bitter ingredients found in some alcoholic beverages including hops in beer and gentian in bitters.<br/>There are few regularly consumed foods rich in fat taste, due to the negative flavor that is evoked in large quantities.<br/>Many people consider blood to have a metallic taste.<br/>Other ions of the alkali metals group also taste salty, but the further from sodium, the less salty the sensation is.<br/>Sweet taste signals the presence of carbohydrates in solution.<br/><br/><br/><strong>natural foods</strong><strong>: </strong>\" Natural flavorings are explicitly defined by separate laws.<br/>There are different standards for various types of food, such as dairy products.<br/>The term is variously misused on labels and in advertisements.<br/>The term is assumed to describe foods having ingredients that are intrinsic to an unprocessed food.<br/>There is no legal recourse to prevent this labeling.<br/>for the distribution of non-proprietary natural, organic and specialty products.<br/>The poultry industry has been criticized by the Center for Science in the Public Interest for labeling chicken meat \"all-natural\" after it has been injected with saline solution up to 25% of its weight.<br/>Because few regulations are governing the labeling of \"natural\" foods, manufacturers can include ingredients that may not be considered natural by some consumers.<br/>The guidance, in general, restricts the use of natural to foods that have \"ingredients produced by nature, not the work of man or interfered with by man.<br/>A specific ingredient can be called \"natural\" if it didn't go through any processing except for the listed ones.<br/><br/><br/><strong>end</strong><strong>: </strong>the initial version of the film was Seth Rogen and Busta Rhymes were filming a music video and a film respectively, on the Sony lot, and Antmen attacked from the center of the earth.<br/>That's the screwball scenario of This Is the End.<br/>And the popularity of reality television now also feeds into that idea of whether what we're

\"mini SUV\".<br/>The next larger size is called the \"mid-size SUV\".<br/>The first SUV-like vehicle that had commercial versions was the Chevrolet Suburban panel truck.<br/>Since the early 2010s, sales of crossover-type vehicles have been increasing in Europe.<br/>Furthermore, there are inconsistencies about whether some vehicles are considered crossovers or SUVs.<br/>Some mid-size SUVs are based on platforms shared with passenger cars and therefore, are crossovers.<br/>However, these definitions are often blurred in practice, since unibody vehicles are also often referred to as SUVs.<br/>however, broader definitions consider any vehicle with off-road design features to be an SUV.<br/>Some SUVs produced today use unibody construction.<br/>It is also suggested that the term \"SUV\" has replaced \"jeep\" as a general term for off-road vehicle.<br/><br/><br/><strong>truck</strong><strong>: </strong>This type of cab is especially suited to the delivery conditions in Europe where many roads follow the layout of much more ancient paths and trackways which require the additional turning capability given by the short wheelbase of the cab over engine type.<br/>A further step from this is the side loading forklift that can be described as a specially fabricated vehicle with the same properties as a truck of this type, in addition to the ability to pick up its own load.<br/>This type is often made by replacing the passenger side of a cab-over truck with an extended section of the load bed.<br/>Pickup trucks, called utes in Australia and New Zealand, are common in North America and some regions of Latin America, Asia, and Africa, but not so in Europe, where this size of commercial vehicle is most often made as vans.<br/>A pickup with four rear wheels instead of two is, in North America, called a \"dually\", which is able to carry more weight over the rear axle.<br/>The most-recent pickup truck on sale in Japan is Toyota Hilux.<br/>The C license category allows driving vehicles over 3.<br/>In the United States, a commercial driver's license is required to drive any type of commercial vehicle weighing 26,001 lb (11,794 kg) or more.<br/>Small trucks use the same type of transmissions as almost all cars, having either an automatic transmission or a manual transmission with synchromesh (synchronizers).<br/>Almost all heavy truck transmissions are of the \"range and split\" (double H shift pattern) type, where range change and so\u2011called half gears or splits are air operated and always preselected before the main gear selection.<br/><br/><br/><strong>b</strong><strong>: </strong>Instead, Fraktur is considered a class of fonts of the Latin alphabet.<br/>The blood-type B emoji (\ud83c\udd71\ufe0f) was added in Unicode 6.<br/>These fonts were designed in the early 20th century, mainly the 1930s, as grotesque versions of blackletter typefaces.<br/>Groups that use both form of traditional German script are the Amish, Old Order Mennonites, Hutterites, and traditional German-speaking Mennonites from Russia who live mostly in Latin America today.<br/>however, the predominant typeface was the Normalfraktur, which came in slight variations.<br/>The present forms of the English cursive B were developed by the 17th century.<br/>Some Fraktur typefaces also include a variant form of the letter r known as the r rotunda, and many a variety of ligatures which are left over from cursive handwriting and have rules for their use.<br/>The following set of Fraktur and bold Fraktur letters is intended for use as mathematical alphanumeric symbols:.<br/>Some books at that time used related blackletter fonts such as Schwabacher.<br/>The Greek letter was an adaptation of the Phoenician letter b\u0113t

coaches, charge a fare.<br/>The most common type is the single-deck rigid bus, with larger loads carried by double-decker and articulated buses, and smaller loads carried by midibuses and minibuses while coaches are used for longer-distance services.<br/>Historically, the types and features of buses have developed according to local needs.<br/>The bus types in use around the world where there was little mass production were often sourced second hand from other countries, such as the Malta bus, and buses in use in Africa.<br/>Another use is as an emergency vehicle, such as high-capacity ambulance bus or mobile command centre.<br/>Other types, such as elementary or secondary school buses or shuttle buses within a post-secondary education campus do not charge a fare.<br/>While many preserved buses are quite old or even vintage, in some cases relatively new examples of a bus type can enter restoration.<br/>A bus is a vehicle designed to carry passengers.<br/>In some countries, particularly the US and Canada, buses used to transport schoolchildren have evolved into a specific design with specified mandatory features.<br/>The first mass-produced bus model was the B-type double-decker bus, designed by Frank Searle and operated by the London General Omnibus Company \u2013 it entered service in 1910, and almost 3,000 had been built by the end of the decade.<br/><br/><br/><strong>police</strong><strong>: </strong>The average police patrol vehicle is a specially modified, four door sedan (saloon in British English).<br/>In some cases this type of policing shares aspects with espionage.<br/>Other federal agencies have jurisdiction over a specific type of crime.<br/>These units are typically called Inspectorate-General, or in the US, \"internal

these were initially called \"jeeps\", before the quarter-ton Willys MB and Ford GPW.<br/>Escort carrier \u2013 a small, anti-submarine, escort aircraft carrier was called a \"jeep carrier\" in the U.<br/>Although the term was also military slang for vehicles that were untried or untested, this exposure caused all other jeep references to fade, leaving the 4x4 with the name.<br/>Another benefit of solid axle vehicles is they tend to be easier and cheaper to \"lift\" with aftermarket suspension systems.<br/><br/><br/><strong>car</strong><strong>: </strong>The increase in sales of SUVs is bad

produced by one company, called the General Motors Companion Make Program, so that buyers could \"move up\" as their fortunes improved.<br/>On the other hand, sports cars are most often designed with only two seats.<br/>Most cars are designed to carry multiple occupants, often with four or five seats.<br/>Some vehicles also have a trunk light and, more rarely, an engine compartment light.<br/>Most definitions of cars say that they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people rather than goods.<br/>Additional individual modes of transport, such as personal rapid transit could serve as an alternative to cars if they prove to be socially accepted.<br/><br/><br/>", "concept": "<strong>land vehicle</strong><strong>: </strong>troop transport

</strong>In lower-quality scissors, the cutting edges are not particularly sharp.<br/>I think a kid listening to Eminem is getting a much more negative message than what we've been putting forward.<br/>In Pakistan, some believe that scissors should never be idly opened and closed without purpose.<br/>Children's scissors are usually not particularly sharp, and the tips of the blades are often blunted or 'rounded' for safety.<br/>In high-quality scissors, the blades can be both extremely sharp, and tension sprung \u2013 to increase the cutting and shearing tension only at the exact point where the blades meet.<br/>it is primarily the shearing action between the two blades that cuts the material.<br/>Furthermore, with right-handed scissors held by the right hand, the shearing edge is visible, but when they are used with the left hand, the cutting edge of the scissors is behind the top blade, and one cannot see what is being cut.<br/>Some quadriplegics can use a motorized

karambit may be sharp and if so may also feature a backward-facing point.<br/>The combination provided a sword that would resist impact while remaining sharp, even though the edge could chip if abused.<br/>This method yields an edge that can hold its sharpness as well as a body that is tough.<br/>The handle or back of the blade has a large area compared to the fine edge.<br/>Its blade is much thicker than a knife of comparable size.<br/>The lower illustration is a modified tanto where the end is clipped and often sharpened.<br/>The back edge of the clip may have a false edge that could be sharpened to make a second edge.<br/>If the false edge is sharpened it increases the knife's effectiveness in piercing.<br/>A stronger edge is less likely to dull from fracture or from having the edge roll out of shape.<br/><br/><br/><strong>knife</strong><strong>: </strong>Hollow ground blades have concave, beveled edges.<br/>In this case, however, the part most affected by corrosion, the edge, is still vulnerable.<br/>High carbon stainless steel blades do not discolor or stain, and maintain a sharp edge.<br/>rather, the blade itself is the actuator.<br/>Ceramic blades are hard, brittle, and lightweight: they may maintain a sharp edge for years with no maintenance at all, but are as fragile as glass and will break if dropped on a hard surface.<br/>Plastic blades are not especially sharp and typically serrated.<br/>These edges are usually serrated and are used to further enhance function.<br/>Flat ground blades have a profile that tapers from the thick spine to the

dagger-stab.<br/>I have asked His Excellency to now bring those circles to power which we have to thank for coming so far.<br/>The belief was that the German Army did not lose World War I on the

overthrew the Hohenzollern monarchy in the German Revolution of 1918\u20131919.<br/>\"Yes, that's it, exactly, we were stabbed in the back\".<br/>He suggests that behind these myths was a sense of

tapered) glass bottle.<br/>Mathmos lava lamps are still made in the original factory in Poole, Dorset.<br/>A lava lamp is a decorative lamp, invented in 1963 by British entrepreneur Edward Craven Walker, the founder of the lighting company Mathmos.<br/>However, lava lamps made for the US market since 1970 do not use carbon tetrachloride, because its use was banned that year due to toxicity.<br/>As of 2016, lava lamps were being sold under Lifespan brands in North America.<br/>Lavarand, a random number generator that used lava lamps.<br/>British entrepreneur Edward Craven Walker had the idea for the lava lamp in 1963 after watching a homemade egg timer, which was made from a cocktail shaker filled with liquids, as it was bubbling on a stove top in a pub.<br/><br/><br/><strong>tiffany lamp</strong><strong>: </strong>Every lamp is prepared by using the copper foil method.<br/>Next is the Transition to Flowers group, which is subdivided into the

herds were devastated because of demand for ivory, to be used for piano keys.<br/>The use and trade of elephant ivory have become controversial because they have contributed to seriously declining elephant populations in many countries.<br/>The Buddhist cultures of Southeast Asia, including Myanmar, Thailand, Laos and Cambodia, traditionally harvested ivory from their domesticated elephants.<br/><br/><br/><strong>sleep</strong><strong>: </strong>Sleep is a highly conserved behavior across animal evolution.<br/>Process C counteracts the homeostatic drive for sleep during the day (in diurnal animals) and augments it at night.<br/>Many cultural stories have been told about people falling asleep for extended periods of time.<br/>\" This theory is strengthened by the fact that sleep is observed to be a necessary behavior across most of the animal kingdom, including some of the least evolved animals which have no need for other functions of sleep, such as memory consolidation or dreaming.<br/>The balance between sleeping and waking is regulated by a process called homeostasis.<br/>The human organism physically restores itself during sleep, occurring mostly during slow-wave sleep during which body temperature, heart rate, and brain oxygen consumption decrease.<br/>The use of artificial light has substantially altered humanity's sleep patterns.<br/>In many nomadic or hunter-gatherer societies, people will sleep on and off throughout the day or night depending on what is happening.<br/>Bimodal sleep in humans was more common before the industrial revolution.<br/>During Ramadan, many Muslims sleep during the day rather than at night.<br/><br/><br/><strong>indian elephant</strong><strong>: </strong>Poaching of elephants for ivory is a serious threat in some parts of Asia.<br/>In Myanmar, demand for elephant ivory for making tourist items is higher than ever before.<br/>Foreign tourists are responsible for the massive rise in price of ivory tusks which fuels the illegal killing of elephants.<br/>Elephants are classified as megaherbivores and consume up to 150 kg (330 lb) of plant matter per day.<br/>They are generalist feeders, and both grazers and browsers.<br/>The tip of their trunk has one finger-like process.<br/>The Asian elephant is threatened by habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation.<br/>The Indian elephant is native to mainland Asia: India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Myanmar, Thailand, Malay Peninsula, Laos, China, Cambodia, and Vietnam.<br/>They browse more in the dry season with bark constituting a major part of their diet in the cool part of that season.<br/>Their skin colour is lighter than that of E.<br/><br/><br/><strong>this animal</strong><strong>: </strong>Some animals are capable of asexual reproduction, which often results in a genetic clone of the parent.<br/>Several animals are microscopic.<br/>A wide variety of terrestrial and aquatic animals are hunted for sport.<br/>Dogs have been used in hunting, while many terrestrial and aquatic animals were hunted for sports.<br/>Marine fish of many species are caught commercially for food.<br/>Other animals may have very specific feeding behaviours, such as hawksbill sea turtles primarily eating sponges.<br/>Most animals rely on the biomass and energy produced by plants through photosynthesis.<br/>Animals have been hunted and farmed for their fur to make items such as coats and hats.<br/>Nearly all animals make use of some form of sexual reproduction.<br/>Several animal phyla lack bilateral symmetry.<br/><br/><br/><strong>tusk</strong><strong>: </strong>Most mammals with tusks have a pair of them growing out from either side of the mouth.<br/>It has been suggested that tusk's structure has evolved to be compatible with extra-oral environments.<br/>Tusks are used by humans to produce ivory, which is used in artifacts and jewellery, and formerly in other items such as piano keys.<br/>Tusks have a variety of uses depending on the animal.<br/>The narwhal's straight single helical tusk, which grows out from the center of the mouth and is present only in the male, is an exception to the typical features of tusks described above.<br/>In most tusked species both the males and the females have tusks although the males' are larger.<br/>Consequently, many tusk-bearing species have been hunted commercially and several are endangered.<br/>Continuous growth of tusks is enabled by formative tissues in the apical openings of the roots of the teeth.<br/>Elephants use their tusks as digging and boring tools.<br/>Social displays of dominance, particularly among males, are common, as is their use in defense against attackers.<br/><br/><br/><strong>trunk</strong><strong>: </strong>Trunking is closely related to the concept of grading.<br/>This is similar to the idea of a chain of grocery stores.<br/>This is reminiscent to the structure of a tree with one trunk and many branches.<br/>TRS's are more difficult to monitor via radio scanner than conventional systems.<br/>Trunk lines are used for connecting a private branch exchange (PBX) to a telephone service provider.<br/>The shopper generally goes to the nearest grocery store, but if there are complications or congestion, the shopper may opt to go to a neighboring store.<br/>Such high-bandwidth link groups may be used to interconnect switches or to connect high-performance servers to a network.<br/>Trunked radio systems provide greater efficiency at the cost of greater management overhead.<br/>1Q is an open standard, it is the only option in an environment with multiple-vendor equipment.<br/>Elephant trunk, the proboscis of an

it when in musth.<br/>These animals were relatively small and aquatic.<br/>The animal's sense of smell may be four times as sensitive as that of a bloodhound.<br/>They can sometimes be known for their violent behavior.<br/>One elephant has been observed to graze by kneeling on its front legs, raising on its hind legs and taking in grass with its lips.<br/>In some countries, sport hunting of the animals is legal.<br/>A newly developed tusk has a smooth enamel cap that eventually wears off.<br/><br/><br/><strong>hunt</strong><strong>: </strong>Many species of animals have been hunted throughout history.<br/>Some animals, such as wild rabbits or squirrels, may be utilised for fur or meat, but often no use is made of the carcass.<br/>Different breeds of dogs are used for different types of hunting.<br/>All native animals are protected by law, and can only be killed under a special permit.<br/>Hunting in Australia has evolved around the hunting and eradication of various animals considered to be pests.<br/>Typically, game animals are divided into several categories for regulatory purposes.<br/>Even figures considered divine are described to have engaged in hunting.<br/>It is argued that the animals are worth more to the community for ecotourism than hunting.<br/>All these animals have been hunted to endangerment or extinction.<br/>New Zealand has a strong hunting

ceremony was banned by the U.<br/>In China, the one child policy was largely responsible for an unbalanced sex ratio.<br/>Thus, where a girl's future well-being depended upon marrying her to a man who was economically self-sufficient, it was crucial to prepare her to meet whatever qualities or skills were popularly expected of wives.<br/>Beginning in the late Victorian era, more nuanced depictions of girl protagonists became popular.<br/>Sex-selective abortion, as well as rejection of girl children is common.<br/><br/><br/><strong>plaid shirt</strong><strong>: </strong>The weft is generally coarser than the warp.<br/>The weave is often hidden by napping on one or both sides.<br/>The flannel-like appearance is created by creating a nap from the weft.<br/>However, it is actually just a form of fabric and there can be flannel shirts that are not plaid.<br/>However, few of the mass-produced plaid shirts available at the time were actually made out of flannel.<br/>If the flannel is not napped, it gains its softness through the loosely spun yarn in its woven form.<br/>Flannel was originally made from carded wool or worsted yarn, but is now often made from either wool, cotton, or synthetic fiber.<br/>Brushing is a mechanical process wherein a fine metal brush rubs the fabric to raise fine fibres from the loosely spun yarns to form a nap on one or both sides.<br/>Flannel is commonly used to make tartan clothing, blankets, bed sheets, and sleepwear.<br/>Flannelette can either have long or short nap, and can be napped on one or two sides.<br/><br/><br/><strong>stomach</strong><strong>: </strong>This layer is concentric to the longitudinal axis of the stomach.<br/>In birds and crocodilians, the stomach is divided into two

feature widely spaced, scattered trees.<br/>A number of techniques have been employed to clear or kill woody plants in savannas.<br/>It has been suggested by many authors that aboriginal burning created a structurally more open savanna landscape.<br/>A number of exotic plants species have been introduced to the savannas around the world.<br/>Along the trail, visitors can observe native animals, such as Florida panthers, Eastern timber wolves, and alligators in their natural habitat.<br/>However, in many savannas, tree densities are higher and trees are more regularly spaced than in forests.<br/>The consumption of herbage by introduced grazers in savanna woodlands has led to a reduction in the amount of fuel available for burning and resulted in fewer and cooler fires.<br/>Some authors have suggested that savannas and grasslands may become even more susceptible to woody plant encroachment as a result of greenhouse induced climate change.<br/>Human induced climate change

game</strong><strong>: </strong>In role-playing video games, the computer performs the function of the gamemaster.<br/>These games feature a first-person display for movement, combined with an overhead tactical display for combat.<br/>The training system is similar to the way the Basic Role-Playing system works.<br/>The plot is usually divided so that each game location is an opportunity to reveal a new chapter in the story.<br/>However, an isometric or aerial top-down perspective is common in party-based RPGs, in order to give the player a clear view of their entire party and their surroundings.<br/>This may sometimes be implemented as a skill tree.<br/>The game is presented in an isometric view with the player in control of Zagreus.<br/>As with the technology trees seen in strategy video games, learning a particular skill in the tree will unlock more powerful skills deeper in the tree.<br/>Success at that action depends on the character's numeric attributes.<br/>The game's story is often mapped onto exploration, where each chapter of the story is mapped onto a different location.<br/><br/><br/><strong>the object</strong><strong>: </strong>The attributes and methods of the prototype are delegated to all the objects of the equivalence class defined by this prototype.<br/>This variable is late-bound.<br/>Every object has one prototype link (and only one).<br/>at least one other parameter object is involved in the method choice), one speaks of multiple dispatch.<br/>Object composition is used to represent \"has-a\" relationships: every employee has an address, so every Employee object has access to a place to store an Address object (either directly embedded within itself, or at a separate location addressed via a pointer).<br/>In Java, the final keyword can be used to prevent a class from being subclassed.<br/>For example, objects of type Circle and Square are derived from a common class called Shape.<br/>Languages with abstract data type support which may be used to resemble OO programming, but without all features of object-orientation.<br/>For example, the circle-ellipse problem is difficult to handle using OOP's concept of inheritance.<br/>External code can use an object by calling a specific instance method with a certain set of input parameters, read an instance variable, or write to an instance variable.<br/><br/><br/><strong>scroll</strong><strong>: </strong>Typically, the scroll is consumed in the process.<br/>It is unrolled from side to side, and the text is written in lines from the top to the bottom of the page.<br/>A special Chinese form of short book, called the \"whirlwind book,\" consists of several pieces of paper bound at the top with bamboo and then rolled up.<br/>The scroll is made up of 58 sections of soft sheep leather.<br/>The scroll is usually unrolled so that one page is exposed at a time, for writing or reading, with the remaining pages rolled up to the left and right of the visible page.<br/>The ink used in writing scrolls had to adhere to a surface that was rolled and unrolled, so special inks were developed.<br/>Rolls may still be many meters or feet long, and were used in the medieval and Early Modern period in Europe and various West Asian cultures for manuscript administrative documents intended for various uses, including accounting, rent-rolls, legal agreements, and inventories.<br/>Eventually, the folds were cut into sheets, or \"leaves,\" and bound together along one edge.<br/>Parchment scrolls were used by the Israelites among others before the codex or bound book with parchment pages was invented by the Romans, which became popular around the 1st century AD.<br/>History of scroll use.<br/><br/><br/><strong>work</strong><strong>: </strong>All pages with titles containing Work.<br/>All pages with titles beginning with Work.<br/>Employment, a relationship between two parties where work is paid for.<br/>Creative work, a manifestation of creative effort.<br/>People with the surname.<br/>House work, housework, or homemaking.<br/>Broadcast call signs.<br/>Work and Non Work is a compilation album by British indie electronic group Broadcast, released 9 June 1997 by Warp.<br/>Work (electric field), the work done on a charged particle by an electric field.<br/>Career, an individual's journey through learning, work and other aspects of life.<br/><br/><br/><strong>white monitor</strong><strong>: </strong>This method of measurement is inherited from the method used for the first generation of CRT television, when picture tubes with circular faces were in common use.<br/>A panel mount computer monitor is intended for mounting into a flat surface with the front of the display unit protruding just slightly.<br/>advanced hardware driver for backlit modules with local zones of uniformity correction.<br/>An arcade video game would be a good example with the display mounted inside the cabinet.<br/>Multiple technologies have been used for computer monitors.<br/>The display is visible only when the display is pulled out of the rack and deployed.<br/>A picture that uses colors that are outside the sRGB color space will display on an sRGB color space monitor with limitations.<br/>These monitors use touching of the screen as an input method.<br/>Some of these triangles are smaller than the sRGB triangle, some are larger.<br/>Since these circular tubes were used to display rectangular images, the diagonal measurement of the rectangular image was smaller than the diameter of the tube's face (due to the thickness of the glass).<br/><br/><br/><strong>apple inc.</strong><strong>: </strong>The camera cover is sapphire crystal.<br/>The bite is the signified and the computer storage unit, byte, is the signifier.<br/>Again, using Saussure\u2019s semiotic model, the signified, is an apple, but with a bite taken out of it.<br/>The rainbow color of the logo portrays the message that its computer monitor could be producing color images.<br/>The chamfers [smoothed-off edges] are cut with diamond-tipped cutters.<br/>The first two Apple logos are drastically different from each other.<br/>The body is made from a single piece of machined aluminum.<br/>The signifier represents discovery, innovation, and the notion of thought.<br/>Each product receives a Gold, Silver, or Bronze rank depending on its efficiency and sustainability.<br/>Semiotic research can be used to help a company relate to their customer\u2019s culture over time and help their brand to stand out in competitive markets.<br/><br/><br/><strong>the round top</strong><strong>: </strong>The Myth of Little Round Top.<br/>Later the town was renamed \"Round Top\", since the postmaster lived in a house with a round tower.<br/>Battle of Little Round Top.<br/>Twilight at Little Round Top.<br/>James Barnes, to Little Round Top.<br/>Big Round Top.<br/>One of the first public uses of \"Little Round Top\" was by Edward Everett in his oration at the dedication of the Soldiers' National Cemetery on November 19, 1863.<br/>Little Round Top: A Detailed Tour Guide.<br/>Hood's division stepped off first, but instead of guiding on the road, elements began to swing directly to the east in the direction of the Round Tops.<br/>The elevation in the center of Round Top is 439 feet (134 m) above sea level.<br/><br/><br/><strong>office</strong><strong>: </strong>The type of office layout used in Japan is called an open plan, and relies on ergonomics to help make employees as productive as possible.<br/>The role of having an open layout with island-type seating allows the office to be structured so the employees are put together as teams.<br/>As a result, in 1915, the Equitable Life Insurance Company in New York City introduced the \u201cModern Efficiency Desk\u201d with a flat top and drawers below, designed to allow managers an easy view of the workers.<br/>The type of organizational structure found within the Japanese office is known as a horizontal structure.<br/>Taylor (1856-1915) led to the \"Modern Efficiency Desk\" of 1915 with a flat top and drawers below, designed to allow managers an easy view of the workers.<br/>In order to get group members to work effectively in the open office floor plan the use of island-style desks are used.<br/>Support spaces in an office are typically used for secondary activities such as filing documents or taking a break.<br/>The Japanese open office layout allows them to use an organizational structure known as the horizontal structure.<br/>Also they are able to implement policies using the ringi-sho consensus.<br/>Work spaces in an office are typically used for conventional office activities such as reading, writing and computer work.<br/><br/><br/><strong>books</strong><strong>: </strong>Some physical books are made with pages thick and sturdy enough to support other physical objects, like a scrapbook or photograph album.<br/>The inside back cover page, like that inside the front cover, is usually blank.<br/>Many types of book are private, often filled in by the owner, for a variety of personal records.<br/>The inside front cover page is usually left blank in both hardcover and paperback books.<br/>Hardcover books have a stiff binding.<br/>It was historically used for writing documents, notes, or the pages of a book.<br/>There are texts written in red or even gold, and different colors were used for illumination.<br/>They often feature spiral coil bindings at the edge so that pages may easily be torn out.<br/>The first books used parchment or vellum (calfskin) for the pages.<br/>Finally, the book was bound by the bookbinder.<br/><br/><br/><strong>video game</strong><strong>: </strong>Early games used interactive electronic devices with various display formats.<br/>Some motion sensor games are based on where the controller is.<br/>Other game controllers are commonly used for specific games like racing wheels, light guns or dance pads.<br/>Video game can use several types of input devices to translate human actions to a game.<br/>Arcade games often have brightly painted logos and images relating to the theme of the game.<br/>While most arcade games are housed in a vertical cabinet, which the user typically stands in front of to play, some arcade games use a tabletop approach, in which the display screen is housed in a table-style cabinet with a see-through table top.<br/>With table-top games, the users typically sit to play.<br/>Other type of motion sensor games are webcam style where the player moves around in front of it, and the actions are repeated by a game character.<br/>There are some controllers that have presets so that the buttons are mapped a certain way to make playing certain games easier.<br/>Another example is motion sensor where a person's movement is able to be captured and put into a game.<br/><br/><br/><strong>compute</strong><strong>: </strong>The program has an executable form that the computer can use directly to execute the instructions.<br/>Abaci, of a more modern design, are still used as calculation tools today.<br/>This allows the separation of RAM from CPU by optical interconnects.<br/>Quantum computing is often used for scientific research where a normal computer does not have nearly enough computational power to do the calculations necessary.<br/>Instructions express the computations performed by the computer.<br/>This means the qubit is not somewhere between 1 and 0, but actually the value of the qubit will change depending on when you measure it.<br/>The earliest known tool for use in computation was the abacus, and it was thought to have been invented in Babylon circa 2400 BC.<br/>In earlier times, it was used in reference to the action performed by mechanical computing machines, and before that, to human computers.<br/>Those actions produce effects according to the semantics of the instructions.<br/>This source code is written in a programming language, which is an artificial language often more restrictive or demanding than natural languages, but easily translated by the computer.<br/><br/><br/><strong>computer</strong><strong>: </strong>Slide rules with special scales are still used for quick performance of routine calculations, such as the E6B circular slide rule used for time and distance calculations on light aircraft.<br/>The abacus was initially used for arithmetic tasks.<br/>Registers are used for the most frequently needed data items to avoid having to access main memory every time data is needed.<br/>A digital computer is capable of simulating various information processes.<br/>Sometimes programs are executed by a hybrid method of the two techniques.<br/>A 2016-era flat screen display contains its own computer circuitry.<br/>It is a hand-operated analog computer for doing multiplication and division.<br/>ROM is typically used to store the computer's initial start-up instructions.<br/>The use of counting rods is one example.<br/>The term hardware covers all of those parts of a computer that are tangible physical objects.<br/><br/><br/><strong>stacked papers</strong><strong>: </strong>This time, the cable protocol is used to send the data to C.<br/>Instead, the layer provides the definitions that permit translation to occur between a range of services or technologies used below.<br/>Most animal caches are of food.<br/>Thus, in somewhat abstract terms, at and above such a layer common standards contribute to interoperation, while below the layer translation is used.<br/>As a practical matter, real interoperation is achieved by the definition and use of effective spanning layers.<br/>This will make two stacks of two protocols each.<br/>The inter-network protocol will communicate with each of the base protocol in their simpler language.<br/>For example, this interface level would define how TCP/IP transport software would talk to the network interface controller.<br/>Each higher layer adds additional capabilities.<br/>An inter-network protocol is required to connect them.<br/><br/><br/>", "concept": "<strong>scroll</strong><strong>: </strong>below fold is related to scroll<br/>above fold is related to scroll<br/>scroll is manner of move<br/>scroll lock is

Magellan's voyage from the Strait of Magellan to the Philippines, the explorer indeed found the ocean peaceful.<br/>Magellan called the ocean Pac\u00edfico (or \"Pacific\" meaning, \"peaceful\") because, after sailing through the stormy seas off Cape Horn, the expedition found calm waters.<br/>The trade winds in the southern and eastern Pacific are remarkably steady while conditions in the North Pacific are far more varied with, for example, cold winter temperatures on the east coast of Russia contrasting with the milder weather off British Columbia during the winter months due to the preferred flow of ocean currents.<br/>however, the Pacific is not always peaceful.<br/>To Magellan, it seemed much more calm (pacific) than the Atlantic.<br/>When the ITCZ is positioned north or south of the Equator, these directions change according to the Coriolis effect imparted by Earth's rotation.<br/>As trans-equator sea voyages became more common, sailors in the eighteenth century named this

non-monarchical states writers, most importantly Leonardo Bruni, adopted the Latin phrase res publica.<br/>The term republic originated from the writers of the Renaissance as a descriptive term for states that were not monarchies.<br/>Modern scholars note the word democracy at the time of the 3rd century BC and later suffered from degradation and could mean any autonomous state, no matter how oligarchic in nature.<br/>However, the term republic is not synonymous with the republican form.<br/>They used terms such as libertas populi, a free people, to describe the states.<br/>While Bruni and Machiavelli used the term to describe the states of Northern Italy, which were not monarchies, the term res publica has a set of interrelated meanings in the original Latin.<br/>Likewise, in Polish the term was translated as rzeczpospolita, although the translation is now only used with respect to Poland.<br/>At its core, the literal meaning of the word republic when used to reference a form of government means: \"a country that is governed by elected representatives and by an elected leader (such as a president) rather than by a king or queen\".<br/>Paul Adams observes that republic is most often used in the United States as a synonym for \"state\" or \"government,\" but with more positive connotations than either of those terms.<br/><br/><br/><strong>yellow banana</strong><strong>:

advocated the name kalium for potassium, with the chemical symbol \"K\".<br/>The \"Gold Book\" of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry has designated the official chemical symbol as K.<br/>When Humphry Davy first isolated the pure element using electrolysis in 1807, he named it potassium, which he derived from the word potash.<br/>The English name for the element potassium comes from the word \"potash\", which refers to an early method of extracting various potassium salts: placing in a pot the ash of burnt wood or tree leaves, adding water, heating, and evaporating the solution.<br/>It adopts a face-centered cubic structure.<br/>The English and French speaking countries adopted Davy and Gay-Lussac/Th\u00e9nard's name Potassium, while the Germanic countries adopted Gilbert/Klaproth's name Kalium.<br/>Potassium was the first metal that was isolated by electrolysis.<br/>Megatons of these compounds are produced annually.<br/>Minerals are dated by measurement of the concentration of potassium and the amount of radiogenic 40Ar that has accumulated.<br/>Glass manufacturers use granular potash as a flux, lowering the temperature at which a mixture

mercury can contaminate the surrounding environment.<br/><br/><br/><strong>electrical</strong><strong>: </strong>A succession of sparks jumping from the key to the back of his hand showed that lightning was indeed electrical in nature.<br/>While this method, now known as the triboelectric effect, can lift light objects and generate sparks, it is extremely inefficient.<br/>A current was allowed through a wire suspended from a pivot above the magnet and dipped into the mercury.<br/>The induced voltage is proportional to the time rate of change of the current.<br/>The resistive Joule heating effect employed in filament light bulbs also sees more direct use in electric heating.<br/>The level of electromagnetic emissions generated by electric arcing is high enough to produce electromagnetic interference, which can be detrimental to the workings of adjacent equipment.<br/>A lightweight ball suspended from a string can be charged by touching it with a glass rod that has itself been charged by rubbing with a cloth.<br/>The pain caused by an electric shock can be intense, leading electricity at times to be employed as a method of torture.<br/>The voltage of a large lightning cloud may be as high as 100 MV and have discharge energies as great as 250 kWh.<br/>The rapid expansion in electrical technology at this time transformed industry and society, becoming a driving force for the Second Industrial Revolution.<br/><br/><br/><strong>sunset</strong><strong>: </strong>Sometimes just before sunrise or after sunset a green flash can be seen.<br/>The high altitude clouds serve to reflect strongly reddened sunlight still striking the stratosphere after sunset, down to the surface.<br/>Its width is unaltered, so the disk appears wider than it is high.<br/>The remaining reddened sunlight can then be scattered by cloud droplets and other relatively large particles to light up the horizon red and orange.<br/>The colors of the Martian sunset differ from those on Earth.<br/>Some of the most varied colors at sunset can be found in the opposite or eastern sky after the Sun has set during twilight.<br/>Further, because the light from the Sun is refracted as it passes through the Earth's atmosphere, the Sun is still visible after it is geometrically below the horizon.<br/>Light from the bottom edge of the Sun's disk is refracted more than light from the top, since refraction increases as the angle of elevation decreases.<br/>Refraction also affects the apparent shape of the Sun when it is very close to the horizon.<br/>It makes things appear higher in the sky than they really are.<br/><br/><br/><strong>blonde hair</strong><strong>: </strong>The pigmentation of both hair and eyes is lightest around the Baltic Sea, and darkness increases regularly and almost concentrically around this region.<br/>The traces of hair color on Greek korai probably reflect the colors the artists saw in natural hair.<br/>A typical explanation found in the scientific literature for the evolution of light hair is related to the evolution of light skin, and in turn the requirement for vitamin D synthesis and northern Europe's seasonally reduced solar radiation.<br/>In medieval Gothic paintings of the crucifixion of Jesus, the figure of Mary Magdalene is shown with long, blond hair, which flows down her back unbound in contrast to most of the women in the scenes, who are shown with dark hair, normally covered by a scarf.<br/>Other blond characters in the Homeric poems are Peleus, Achilles, Meleager, Agamede, and Rhadamanthys.<br/>The higher frequencies of light hair in Asia are prevalent among Pamiris, Kalash, Nuristani and Uyghur ethnic groups.<br/>Blond hair is most common in light-skinned infants and children, so much so that the term \"baby blond\" is often used for very light colored hair.<br/>Many of these are rephrased sorority girl or Essex girl jokes, much as other jokes about dumb blondes are based on long-running ethnic jokes.<br/>In medieval artwork, female saints are often shown with long, shimmering blond hair, which emphasizes their holiness and virginity.<br/>The Encyclopedia of Hair describes Marilyn Monroe's blonde role in the second film as that of \"a fragile woman who relied on her looks rather than on intelligence\u2014what some people refer to as 'dumb blonde'.<br/><br/><br/><strong>call</strong><strong>: </strong>Call, a command in square dancing, delivered by a caller.<br/>Bird call, part of a bird song.<br/>An infamous blown call in Game Six of the 1985 World Series by Major League Baseball umpire Don Denkinger.<br/>Call, in the game of contract bridge, a bid, pass, double, or redouble in the bidding stage.<br/>Call, an attempt to set up a

animal such as:.<br/><br/><br/><strong>the very bright light</strong><strong>: </strong>In photographs recorded with infrared-sensitive passive (non-IR emitting) equipment, the eyes (not only the pupils) usually appear very bright.<br/>Photographs taken with infrared light through night vision devices always show very bright pupils because, in the dark, the pupils are fully dilated and the infrared light is not absorbed by any ocular pigment.<br/>Theatrical followspot operators, positioned nearly coincidentally with a very bright light and somewhat distant from the actors, occasionally witness red-eye in actors on stage.<br/>In flash photography the light of the flash occurs too fast for the pupil to close, so much of the very bright light from the flash passes into the eye through the pupil, reflects off the fundus at the back of the eyeball and out through the pupil.<br/>The effect is not visible to the rest of the audience because it is reliant on the very small angle between the followspot operator and the light.<br/>When a bright light source is shining on the lens but not in its field of view, lens flare appears as a haze that washes out the image and reduces contrast.<br/>here, the reflected red light is directly visible through the ophthalmoscope.<br/>The light enters the eye in a direction away from the optical axis of the camera and is refocused by the eye lens back along the same axis.<br/>In a photograph of a child's face, if there is red-eye in one eye but not the other, it may be leukocoria, which may be caused by the cancer retinoblastoma.<br/>The amount of red light emerging from the pupil depends on the amount of melanin in the layers behind the retina.<br/><br/><br/><strong>sun</strong><strong>: </strong>Only a very small fraction of the incident light is reflected.<br/>The brightness of the Sun can cause pain from looking at it with the naked eye.<br/>The flash is caused by light from the Sun just below the horizon being bent (usually through a temperature inversion) towards the observer.<br/>The change in opacity is due to the decreasing amount of H\u2212 ions, which absorb visible light easily.<br/>The sunlight that is destined for the eyepiece is reflected from an unsilvered surface of a piece of glass.<br/>The chromosphere, transition region, and corona are much hotter than the surface of the Sun.<br/>Simple filters made of darkened glass allow the full intensity of sunlight to pass through if they break, endangering the observer's eyesight.<br/>The high temperature of the corona shows that it is heated by something other than direct heat conduction from the photosphere.<br/>Photons produced in this layer escape the Sun through the transparent solar atmosphere above it and become solar radiation, sunlight.<br/>Humanity's most fundamental understanding of the Sun is as the luminous disk in the sky, whose presence above the horizon creates day and whose absence causes night.<br/><br/><br/><strong>lamp</strong><strong>: </strong>The pressure inside the lamp is around 0.<br/>The inner surface of the lamp is coated with a fluorescent coating made of varying blends of

a part of the lamp.<br/>If a fluorescent lamp is broken, a very small amount of mercury can contaminate the surrounding environment.<br/>Capacitive coupling with high-voltage power lines can light a lamp continuously at low intensity, depending on the intensity of the electric field, as shown in the image on the right.<br/><br/><br/><strong>the girls head</strong><strong>: </strong>The

Limited Test Ban Treaty of 1963 prohibited above-ground tests, thus by the year 2000 the worldwide dose from these tests has decreased to only 0.<br/>Background radiation doses in the immediate vicinity of particles of high atomic number materials, within the human body, have a small enhancement due to the photoelectric effect.<br/>Background (astronomy), small amounts of light coming from otherwise dark parts of the sky.<br/>About 100,000 Bq/m3 of radon was found in Stanley Watras's basement in 1984.<br/>This radiation is much more intense in the upper troposphere, around 10 km altitude, and is thus of particular concern for airline crews and frequent passengers, who spend many hours per year in this environment.<br/>Some of this contamination is local, rendering the immediate surroundings highly radioactive, while some of it is carried longer distances as nuclear fallout.<br/>This dose is not readily comparable to the radiation protection limits, since the latter deal with whole body doses, while the dose from smoking is delivered to a very small portion of the body.<br/>However, many of their daughter products are strong gamma emitters.<br/>Most of the natural neutron background is a product of cosmic rays interacting with the atmosphere.<br/>Terrestrial radiation, for the purpose of the table above, only includes sources that remain external to the body.<br/><br/><br/><strong>woman</strong><strong>: </strong>The term girl is sometimes  used colloquially to refer to a young or unmarried woman.<br/>The spelling of \"woman\" in English has

other animals have grasping appendages similar in form to a hand such as paws, claws, and talons, but these are not scientifically considered to be grasping hands.<br/>The thumb is undoubtedly the \"master digit\" of the hand, giving value to all the other fingers.<br/>Apes and monkeys are sometimes described as having four hands, because the toes are long and the hallux is opposable and looks more like a thumb, thus enabling the feet to be used as hands.<br/>The fingers may be fused in a disorder known as syndactyly.<br/>There is a hypothesis suggesting the form of the modern human hand is especially conducive to the formation of a compact fist, presumably for fighting purposes.<br/>There are several cutaneous conditions that can affect the hand including the nails.<br/>The scientific use of the term hand in this sense to distinguish the terminations of the front paws from the hind ones is an example of anthropomorphism.<br/>In humans, the big toe is thus more derived than the

vehicle.<br/>The first commercial design for a self-propelled cycle was a three-wheel design called the Butler Petrol Cycle, conceived of Edward Butler in England in 1884.<br/>Many jurisdictions include some forms of three-wheeled cars as motorcycles.<br/>The Butler Petrol Cycle was a three-wheeled vehicle, with the rear wheel directly driven by a 5\u20448 hp (0.<br/>If a two-wheeled vehicle with steam propulsion is considered a motorcycle, then the first motorcycles built seem to be the French Michaux-Perreaux steam velocipede which patent application was filled in December 1868, constructed around the same time as the American Roper steam velocipede, built by Sylvester H.<br/>The first internal combustion, petroleum fueled motorcycle was the Daimler Reitwagen.<br/>A motorcycle is broadly defined by law in most countries for the purposes of registration, taxation and rider licensing as a powered two-wheel motor vehicle.<br/>the weight of the machine was then borne by two small castor wheels.<br/>Electric motorcycles are nearly silent, zero-emission electric motor-driven vehicles.<br/>The 1885 Daimler Reitwagen made by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach in Germany was the first internal combustion, petroleum-fueled motorcycle.<br/><br/><br/><strong>tricycle</strong><strong>: </strong>The trike pictured is called the SUV (Sensible Utility Vehicle) and is

flywheel, brake, gear box and bearings.<br/>The largest vehicle in the world, the Bagger 288, is propelled by continuous tracks.<br/>Many pedalo boats also use paddle wheels for propulsion.<br/>Similarly to propeller vehicles, some vehicles use wings for propulsion.<br/>Most vehicles, with the notable exception of railed vehicles, have at least one steering mechanism.<br/>Screw-propelled vehicles are propelled by auger-like cylinders fitted with helical flanges.<br/>Examples of vehicles using continuous track are tanks, snowmobiles and excavators.<br/>The B-52 Stratofortress has a special arrangement in which all four main wheels can be angled.<br/>Paddle wheels are used on some older watercraft and their reconstructions.<br/>These ships were known as paddle steamers.<br/><br/><br/><strong>the three whelled vehicle</strong><strong>: </strong>The second-gen, high-tech, carbon-fiber car was released in 2004.<br/>The new Dallara DW12 racecar was introduced for the 2012 season.<br/>The sport of open-wheel car racing itself, also historically referred to as Championship Car racing or Indy racing, traces its roots to as early as 1905.<br/>The original series, using first-generation tube-frame cars started in the early 1990s.<br/>The series utilizes tube frame Formula Ford chassis fitted with larger Mazda MZR four cylinder engines and wings and slicks and was originally based on the Formula Continental rules formula.<br/>The new 1997 technical rules featured less expensive chassis and \"production-based\" engines that were purchased rather than leased, but most importantly, were technically incompatible with CART specifications.<br/>The series' primary sponsors is Cooper Tire and the cars, while purpose built for the track with carbon fiber monocoques, are powered by 275 horsepower Mazda-prepared 2 liter MZR-PM18A engines.<br/>There have been five fatal crashes in the history of the series.<br/>The dispute

motorcycle</strong><strong>: </strong>Though many motorcycle clubs wear the three-piece patch arrangement, this is not necessarily an indication that a club is an outlaw motorcycle club.<br/>The three-piece patch consists of the club logo and the top and bottom patches, usually crescent shaped, which are referred to as rockers.<br/>The 1% diamond patch is often worn by the dominant outlaw club in an area or territory.<br/>Some outlaw motorcycle clubs can be distinguished by a \"1%\" patch worn on the colors.<br/>The patch is rectangular and, similar to the patches described above, displays a white background with red letters and a red merrowed border.<br/>The primary visual identification of a member of an outlaw motorcycle club is the vest adorned with a large club-specific patch or patches, predominantly located in the middle of the back.<br/>The number and arrangement of patches is somewhat indicative of the nature of the club.<br/>The colors worn by members of some motorcycle clubs will sometimes follow a convention of using either a one-piece patch for nonconformist social clubs, two-piece patch for clubs paying dues, a three-piece patch for outlaw clubs or side patches.<br/>One percenter motorcycle clubs at Curlie.<br/>The colors and shape of the early-style jacket emblem (prior to 1953) were copied from the insignias of the 85th Fighter Squadron and

possibly a carriage.<br/>The first mechanically-propelled, two-wheeled vehicle may have been built by Kirkpatrick MacMillan, a Scottish blacksmith, in 1839, although the claim is often disputed.<br/>Another style is the recumbent bicycle.<br/>The \"dandy horse\", also called Draisienne or Laufmaschine, was the first human means of transport to use only two wheels in tandem and was invented by the German Baron Karl von Drais.<br/>Its rider sat astride a wooden frame supported by two in-line wheels and pushed the vehicle along with his or her feet while steering the front wheel.<br/>A twin-chain system enables the bike to travel about 3.<br/>A bicycle, also called a bike or cycle, is a human-powered or motor-powered, pedal-driven, single-track vehicle, having two wheels attached to a frame, one behind the other.<br/>The great majority of modern bicycles have a frame with upright seating that looks much like the first chain-driven bike.<br/>It is more common to see bicycles with bottle generators, dynamos, lights, fenders, racks and bells in Europe.<br/>A recumbent bicycle has a reclined chair-like seat that some riders find more comfortable than a saddle, especially riders who suffer from certain types of seat, back, neck, shoulder, or wrist pain.<br/><br/><br/><strong>vespa</strong><strong>: </strong>The scooter was presented to the press at Rome Golf

origins.<br/>The Civic coup\u00e9 is still considered a compact car.<br/>In 1965, Honda built a two-door commercial delivery van, called the Honda L700.<br/>In the 1980s Honda developed the GY6 engine for use in motor scooters.<br/>A four-door station wagon model called the Civic Shuttle (also Civic Pro in Japan) was available from 1984 until 1991 (this brand name would later be revived for the mid-1990s Honda Shuttle people carrier, known in some markets as the Honda Stream).<br/>The vehicle itself does not emit any pollutants and its only by-products are heat and water.<br/>The all-electric Honda EV Plus was introduced in 1997 as a result of CARB's zero-emissions vehicle mandate and was available only for leasing in California.<br/>The company combines participation in

pith helmet can be made out of cork, fibrous, or similar material.<br/>Some of the helmets were printed with a camouflage pattern.<br/>In the narrow definition, a pith helmet is technically a type of sun helmet made out of pith material.<br/>Whatever the material, the pith helmet is designed to shade the wearer's head and face from the sun.<br/>Since the 1990s, most helmets are made from resin or plastic, which may be reinforced with fibers such as aramids.<br/>This helmet is mostly made in Vietnam, where the design was inherited from French colonial patterns.<br/>In the early days of the automobile, some motorists also adopted this style of headgear, and early football helmets were also made of leather.<br/>Imperial Guard units serving in the Korean War often wore these helmets when not in combat.<br/>The two main producers of the US military fiber pressed pith helmet were the International Hat Company and Hawley Products Company.<br/><br/><br/><strong>polyester</strong><strong>: </strong>The futuro house was made of fibreglass-reinforced polyester plastic.<br/>Nearly 70 million barrels of oil are used each year to make polyester around the world, which is now the most

and early football helmets were also made of leather.<br/>Modern helmets have a much wider range of applications, including helmets adapted to the specific needs of many athletic pursuits and work environments, and these helmets very often incorporate plastics and other synthetic materials for their light weight and shock absorption capabilities.<br/>During the Middle Ages, many different military helmets and some ceremonial helmets were developed, almost all being metal.<br/>Race car helmets include a head and neck support system that keeps the helmet (and head) attached to the body in severe collisions.<br/>More specifically, a helmet complements the skull in protecting the human brain.<br/>Some British gamekeepers during the 18th and 19th centuries wore helmets made of straw bound together with cut bramble.<br/>The greatest expansion in the variety of forms and composition of helmets, however, took place in the 20th century, with the development of highly specialized helmets for a multitude of athletic and professional applications, as well as the advent of modern plastics.<br/>Two important helmet types to develop in antiquity were the Corinthian helmet and the Roman galea.<br/><br/><br/><strong>plastic</strong><strong>: </strong>One important classification of plastics is the degree to which the chemical processes used to make them are reversible or not.<br/>The solid rocket propellant used to fuel the Space Shuttle solid rocket booster employs HTPB, a synthetic rubber, as a non-energetic secondary fuel.<br/>Almost 90% of polymer plasticizers, most commonly phthalate esters, are used in PVC, giving this material improved flexibility and durability.<br/>The noun plasticity refers specifically here to the deformability of the materials used in the manufacture of plastics.<br/>While a finished plastic may be non-toxic, the monomers used in the manufacture of its parent polymers may be toxic.<br/>Here are some energetic plasticizers used in rocket propellants and smokeless powders:.<br/>The vast majority of these polymers are formed from chains of carbon atoms, with or without the attachment of oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur atoms.<br/>Meanwhile, 50% to 80% of debris in marine areas is plastic.<br/>In the medical field, polymer implants and other medical devices are derived at least partially from plastic.<br/>Futuro houses are made of fiberglass-reinforced polyesters, polyester-polyurethane, and PMMA.<br/><br/><br/><strong>leather</strong><strong>: </strong>It is the material most commonly used in bullwhips.<br/>Kangaroo leather is used to make items that must be strong and flexible.<br/>Furniture and footwear are often made from full-grain leather.<br/>The production of the PVC used in the production of many artificial leathers requires a plasticizer called a phthalate to make it flexible and soft.<br/>Other animals mentioned below only constitute a fraction of a percent of total leather production.<br/>Many different methods for the manufacture of imitation leathers have been developed.<br/>The amount of leather fibers in the mix varies from 10% to 90%, affecting the properties of the product.<br/>For example, leather shoes bear a label that identifies the animal from which the leather came.<br/>A fermentation method of making collagen, the main chemical in real leather, is under development.<br/>However, there are environmental concerns with this tanning method, as chromium is a heavy metal.<br/><br/><br/><strong>background</strong><strong>: </strong>An example of this is a scintillation detector used for surface contamination monitoring.<br/>The Limited Test Ban Treaty of 1963 prohibited above-ground tests, thus by the year 2000 the worldwide dose from these tests has decreased to only 0.<br/>Instruments used for radiation measurement include the Geiger\u2013M\u00fcller tube and the Scintillation detector.<br/>The increase in background radiation due to these tests peaked in 1963 at about 0.<br/>The average dose from the Three Mile Island accident was 0.<br/>The highest background radiation in an inhabited area is found in Ramsar, primarily due to the use of local naturally radioactive limestone as a building material.<br/>The production of these nuclides varies slightly with short-term variations in solar cosmic ray flux, but is considered practically constant over long scales of thousands to millions of years.<br/>The constant production, incorporation into organisms and relatively short half-life of carbon-14 are the

chromosome.<br/>While the outward signs of masculinity look different in different cultures, there are some common aspects to its definition across cultures.<br/>sometimes the word \"piece\" is defined to exclude pawns.<br/>This difference in the relative amounts of these sex steroids is largely responsible for the physiological differences that distinguish men from women.<br/>Secondary sexual characteristics that are specific to men include:.<br/>In mammals, the hormones that influence sexual differentiation and development are androgens (mainly testosterone), which stimulate later development of the ovary.<br/>This difference in the relative amounts of these sex steroids is responsible for the physiological differences that distinguish men from women.<br/>Although in general men suffer from many of the same illnesses as women, they suffer from slightly more illnesses in comparison to women.<br/><br/><br/>", "concept": "<strong>name</strong><strong>: </strong>a name is

"wiki": "<strong>red shirt</strong><strong>: </strong>Red shirts were worn by the racist and antisemitic Bulgarian Ratniks.<br/>Young men adopted the red shirts to express militancy after being too young to have fought in the Civil War.<br/>Grey shirts were worn by members of the Fatherland League in Norway.<br/>\" Governor Russell's proclamation did not sit well with the Red Shirts.<br/>This created a massive spectacle that united and motivated his followers.<br/>A large celebration on November 15 was organized by Josephus Daniels to commemorate \"white supremacy and rescuing the state from Negro-rule\".<br/>The party leaders of Dravidar Kazhagam in India wear only black shirts to symbolise atheism.<br/>Merton Coulter in The South During Reconstruction (1947), the red shirt was adopted in Mississippi in 1875 by \"southern brigadiers\" of the Democratic Party who were opposed to black Republicans.<br/>Originally worn under other shirts, it is now a common shirt for everyday wear in some countries.<br/>Later, as Teague was traveling to Dunn County, during his canvassing tour of the state, he was kidnapped by the Red Shirts and driven out of town.<br/><br/><br/><strong>jehovah's wit</strong><strong>: </strong>The majority of Witnesses who profess to be anointed have no authority to contribute to the development or change of doctrines.<br/>Each committee is assisted by \"helpers,\" who do not necessarily profess to be \"anointed\".<br/>Disfellowshipping did not mean the wrongdoer was shunned in all social circumstances or by all Bible Students.<br/>The Governing Body is said to provide \"spiritual food\" for Jehovah's Witnesses worldwide.<br/>Raymond Franz claimed he was forced to resign from the Governing Body, and he was later disfellowshipped from the group.<br/>He believed that 1878 marked the \"fall of Babylon\", when God officially judged that Christendom had proven unfaithful.<br/>Under Rutherford's direction, the International Bible Students Association introduced significant doctrinal changes that resulted in many long-term members leaving the organization.<br/>\" Two years later he said the only appropriate names for his group would be \"Church of Christ\", \"Church of God\" or \"Christians\".<br/>schools began expelling Witness children who refused to salute the flag.<br/>From 1927 Bible Students were urged to extend their door-to-door preaching to include Sundays.<br/><br/><br/><strong>catholic</strong><strong>: </strong>This belief is expressed in the Filioque clause which was added to the Latin version of the Nicene Creed of 381 but not included in the Greek versions of the creed used in Eastern Christianity.<br/>Devotions are \"external practices of piety\" which are not part of the official liturgy of the Catholic Church but are part of the popular spiritual practices of Catholics.<br/>In the West confirmation of children is delayed until they are old enough to understand or at the bishop's discretion.<br/>A Catholic marriage, or any marriage between baptised individuals of any Christian denomination, is viewed as a sacrament.<br/>Divorce is increasing in some predominantly Catholic countries in Europe.<br/>\"As a result, Bibles used by English-speaking Catholics for study and devotion typically do not match the liturgical texts read during mass, even when based on the same translation.<br/>According to church doctrine, the sacraments of the church require the proper form, matter, and intent to be validly celebrated.<br/>In the church's teaching, sexual activity is reserved to married couples, whether in a sacramental marriage among Christians or in a natural marriage where one or both spouses are unbaptised.<br/>Many Renaissance figures were sponsored by the church.<br/>This document generated a largely negative response from many Catholics.<br/><br/><br/><strong>celebrate</strong><strong>: </strong>Celebrate, a Christian magazine edited by Peter Youngren.<br/>\"Cel\u00e9brate\", a song by Miki N\u00fa\u00f1ez.<br/>The album produced perhaps Kool & the Gang's most recognizable hit song, the #1 chart-topper, \"Celebration\", which

Christgau of the Village Voice gave a C- grade saying \"It says something for these funk pioneers that unlike James Brown, George Clinton, and the Ohio Players they've adapted painlessly, nay profitably, to disco: a number-one single leads their Deodato-produced album into the top ten.<br/>\" With a 3 out of 5 stars review Amy Hanson of Allmusic found that \"Celebrate itself marked the end

believe that children should not have any worries and should not have to work.<br/>In many cultures, a child is considered an adult after undergoing a rite of passage, which may or may not correspond to the time of puberty.<br/>In Roman times, children were regarded as not culpable for crimes, a position later adopted by the Church.<br/>Children from low income families are less likely to have access to books and computers which would enhance their development.<br/>During the European Renaissance, artistic depictions of children increased dramatically, which did not affect the social attitude to children much, however.<br/>Upon the entrance of school, mental disorders that would normally not be noticed come to light.<br/>In the 19th century, children younger than seven years old were believed incapable of crime.<br/>This change can be traced in paintings: In the Middle Ages, children were portrayed in art as miniature adults with no childlike characteristics.<br/>A right to education has been recognized by some governments.<br/>The age limit of voluntary/involuntary military service is also disputed at the international level.<br/><br/><br/><strong>toddler</strong><strong>: </strong>The toddler is discovering that they are a separate being from their parent and are testing their boundaries in learning the way the world around them works.<br/>Along with self recognition comes feelings of embarrassment and pride that the child had not previously experienced.<br/>Toddlers tend to have temper tantrums because they have such strong emotions but do not know how to express themselves the way that older children and adults do.<br/>The mattress in a toddler bed is often the same size as that in an infant bed.<br/>At this age, children are becoming very proficient at conveying their wants and needs to their parents in a verbal fashion.<br/>There are several other important milestones that are achieved in this time period that parents tend not to emphasize as much as walking and talking.<br/>A toddler bed is low to the ground to facilitate safe and easy entry and exit for the occupant.<br/>Child plays alongside other children but not with them.<br/>Young children squat instinctively as a continuous movement from standing up whenever they want to lower themselves to ground level.<br/>Self-awareness is another milestone that helps parents understand how a toddler is reacting.<br/><br/><br/><strong>boy</strong><strong>: </strong>A boy's first ejaculation is an important milestone in his development.<br/>A boy's muscles increase in size and mass, his voice deepens, his bones lengthen, and the shape of his face and body changes.<br/>On average, a boy's first ejaculation occurs at age 13.<br/>A boy is a human male child or young man.<br/>I have told all the boys that if they wished to stay here and learn, those that had wives must bring them.<br/>When a boy reaches puberty, testosterone triggers the development of secondary sex characteristics.<br/>During puberty, a boy's erect penis becomes capable of ejaculating semen and impregnating a female.<br/>Historically, in the United States and South Africa, \"boy\" was not only a \"neutral\" term for domestics but also a disparaging term towards black men.<br/>The foreskin of some boys' penises is removed in a process known as circumcision.<br/>\"Sex selection in China sees 117 boys born for every 100 girls\".<br/><br/><br/><strong>muslim</strong><strong>: </strong>Two calendars are used all over the Muslim world.<br/>One is a lunar calendar that is most widely used among Muslims.<br/>According to Asma Barlas patriarchal behaviour among Muslims is based in an ideology which jumbles sexual and biological differences with gender dualisms and inequality.<br/>The other one is a solar calendar officially used in Iran and Afghanistan.<br/>Islamic states have adopted Islam as the ideological foundation of state and constitution.<br/>In Afghanistan, seminaries are operated by politically active religious organizations and have taken the place of basic education not provided and funded by the government.<br/>Another figure from the Islamic Golden Age, Avicenna, also founded his own Avicennism school of philosophy, which was influential in both Islamic and Christian lands.<br/>Riada Asimovic Akyol further says that equality for Muslim women needs to be achieved through self-criticism.<br/>In those countries, the legal code is largely secular.<br/>In addition, the average of years of schooling in countries where Muslims are the majority is 6.<br/><br/><br/><strong>this boy</strong><strong>: </strong>A boy's first ejaculation is an important milestone in his development.<br/>A

made a mark with saffron on his forehead, which is called qashqa in the idiom of the Hindus and which they consider lucky.<br/>When we think of the Hindu religion, unlike other religions in the world, the Hindu religion does not claim any one prophet.<br/>Inden states that this practice means different things to different Hindus, and has been misunderstood, misrepresented as idolatry, and various rationalisations have been constructed by both Western and native Indologists.<br/>A specific law, contentious between Hindu nationalists and their opponents in India, relates to the legal age of marriage for girls.<br/>The term 'Hindu' in these ancient records is an ethno-geographical term and did not refer to a religion.<br/>Thus, the Supreme Court was forced to consider the question whether Jainism is part of Hinduism in 2005 and 2006.<br/>The historical meaning of the term Hindu has evolved with time.<br/>One need not be religious in the minimal sense, states Julius Lipner, to be accepted as Hindu by Hindus, or to describe oneself as Hindu.<br/>The Punjab region, called Sapta Sindhu in the Vedas, is called Hapta Hindu in Zend Avesta.<br/>Muslim clerics consider this proposal as unacceptable because under the shariah-derived personal law, a Muslim girl can be married at any age after she reaches puberty.<br/><br/><br/><strong>his birthday</strong><strong>: </strong>In North Korea, people do not celebrate birthdays on July 8 and December 17 because these were the dates of the deaths of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il, respectively.<br/>Origen in his commentary \"On Levites\" writes that Christians should not only refrain from celebrating their birthdays, but should look on them with disgust.<br/>Some Muslims migrating to the United States adopt the custom of celebrating birthdays, especially for children, but others resist.<br/>In Ghana, on their birthday, children wake up to a special treat called \"oto\" which is a patty made from mashed sweet potato and eggs fried in palm oil.<br/>The Lubavitcher Rebbe encouraged people to celebrate their birthdays, by gathering friends, making positive resolutions, and through various religious observances.<br/>In many parts of the world an individual's birthday is celebrated by a party where a specially made cake, usually decorated with lettering and the person's age, is presented.<br/>Some Muslim especially from Salafi school of thought oppose the celebration of a birthday as a sin, as it is considered an \"innovation\" of the faith, or bi'dah while other clerics have issued statements saying that the celebration of a birthday is permissible.<br/>In Korea, many celebrate a traditional ceremony of Baek-il (Feast for the 100th day) and Doljanchi (child's first birthday).<br/>In Judaism, the perspective on birthday celebrations is disputed by various rabbis, although today it is accepted practice by most of the faithful.<br/>As with Christmas, the dates of these celebrations are traditional and probably have no connection with the actual birthdays of these individuals.<br/><br/><br/><strong>christianity</strong><strong>: </strong>Breviaries such as the Shehimo and Agpeya are used by Oriental Orthodox Christians to pray these canonical hours while facing in the eastward direction of prayer.<br/>Jesus' death and resurrection are commemorated by Christians in all worship services, with special emphasis during Holy Week, which includes Good Friday and Easter Sunday.<br/>The Catholic Church teaches that salvation does not occur without faithfulness on the part of Christians.<br/>The cross, today one of the most widely recognized symbols, was used by Christians from the earliest times.<br/>The term \"Protestant\" was not originally used by Reformation era leaders.<br/>There is a diversity of doctrines and liturgical practices among groups calling themselves Christian.<br/>It is also reported that Christianity is popular among people of different backgrounds in Africa and Aisa, according to a report by the Singapore Management University, more people in Southeast Asia are converting to Christianity, many of them are young and have a university degree.<br/>In most countries in the developed world, church attendance among people who continue to identify themselves as Christians has been falling over the last few decades.<br/>The position of Christians affected by Nazism is highly complex.<br/>\"The Trinity is an essential doctrine of mainstream Christianity.<br/><br/><br/><strong>eating</strong><strong>: </strong>Traditional African cultural ideals are reflected in the practice of some health professionals.<br/>For humans, eating is an activity of daily living.<br/>Children as young as ages 5\u20137 are aware of the cultural messages regarding body image and dieting.<br/>For example, most of the Middle Eastern countries, eating while sitting on the floor is most common, and it is believed to be healthier than eating while sitting to a table.<br/>There is a cultural emphasis on thinness which is especially pervasive in western society.<br/>In the majority of many African communities, thinness is generally not seen as an ideal body type and most pressure to attain a slim figure may stem from influence or exposure to Western culture and ideology.<br/>In the past, the available evidence did not suggest that unhealthy weight loss methods and eating disordered behaviors are common in India as proven by stagnant rates of clinically diagnosed eating disorders.<br/>In jurisdictions under Sharia law, it may be proscribed for Muslim adults during the daylight hours of Ramadan.<br/>Newborn babies do not eat adult foods.<br/>in Ghana, pharmacists sell appetite stimulants to women who desire to, as Ghanaians stated, \u201cgrow fat\u201d.<br/><br/><br/><strong>religion</strong><strong>: </strong>Nowadays these religions are practiced only by minorities.<br/>With rare exceptions, Christians do not consider the Old Testament's strict food laws as relevant for today's church.<br/>The term myth can be used pejoratively by both religious and non-religious people.<br/>Schizophrenic episodes are also experienced by people who do not have belief in gods.<br/>For example, the common Christian beliefs of Incarnation, Trinity, and the resurrection of Jesus are not accepted by Judaism or Islam (see for example Islamic view of Jesus' death).<br/>These two religions prohibit the consumption of pork.<br/>The Mandaeans do not worship the God of Abraham and they hate Abraham, considering him, along with Moses, Jesus and Muhammad, to be a false prophet.<br/>However, some foods not considered kosher are considered halal in Islam.<br/>Male circumcision is also widely practiced among Christians from South Korea, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Palestine, Israel, and North Africa.<br/>Parallel concepts are not found in many current and past cultures.<br/><br/><br/><strong>people</strong><strong>: </strong>Outside the United States, criminal trials in Ireland and the Philippines are prosecuted in the name of the people of their respective states.<br/>The political theory underlying this format is that criminal prosecutions are brought in the name of the sovereign.<br/>In criminal law, in certain jurisdictions, criminal prosecutions are brought in the name of the People.<br/>Various states govern or claim to govern in the name of the people.<br/>In Wall's eyes, the party suffered from a lack of media attention and \"opposition from many environmentalists\", which contrasted the experience of other emerging Green parties, such as Germany's Die Gr\u00fcnen.<br/>states, the \"people\" are judged to be the sovereign, even as in the United Kingdom and other dependencies of the British Crown, criminal prosecutions are typically brought in the name of the Crown.<br/>Derek Wall, in his history of the Green Party, contends that the new political movement focused initially on the theme of survival, which shaped the \"bleak evolution\" of the nascent ecological party during the 1970s.<br/>A People's Republic is typically a Marxist or socialist one-party state that claims to govern on behalf of the people even if it in practice often turns out to be a dictatorship.<br/>This article inspired Whittaker and her husband Tony, a former Kenilworth councillor for the Conservative Party, to form a small group of professional and business people called 'Club of Thirteen', so named because it first met on 13 October 1972 in Daventry.<br/>After much debate, the party's 1975 conference adopted a proposal to change its name to the Ecology Party to gain more recognition as the party of environmental concern.<br/><br/><br/><strong>christian</strong><strong>: </strong>The identification of Jesus as the Messiah is not accepted by Judaism.<br/>A wide range of beliefs and practices are found across the world among those who call themselves Christian.<br/>Where there is a distinction, Nasrani refers to people from a Christian culture and Masihi is used by Christians themselves for those with a religious faith in Jesus.<br/>For example, Timothy Beal notes the disparity of beliefs among those who identify as Christians in the United States as follows: Although all of them have their historical roots in Christian theology and tradition, and although most would identify themselves as Christian, many would not identify others within the larger category as Christian.<br/>In fact, the nearly 77 percent of Americans who self-identify as Christian are a diverse pluribus of Christianities that are far from any collective unity.<br/>In Indonesian language, the term \"Nasrani\" is also used alongside \"Kristen\".<br/>In some countries Nasrani tends to be used generically for non-Muslim Western foreigners.<br/>Denominations and sects disagree on a common definition of \"Christianity\".<br/>High birth rates and conversion were cited as the reason for Christian population growth.<br/>By 2050, the Christian population is expected to exceed 3 billion.<br/><br/><br/>", "concept":

"<strong>motocross</strong><strong>: </strong>Pit bikes are frequently heavily customized with decorative add-ons and performance-enhancing parts.<br/>In 1972 Mike Goodwin and Terry Tiernan, the president of the AMA, put on one of these stadium races in the Los Angeles Coliseum.<br/>A typical pit bike is usually a small dirt bike, but it has become common to be able to buy pit bikes with street-style wheels and tires.<br/>Freestyle Motocross (FMX), a relatively new variation of supercross started by the South African champion, Marco Urzi, does not involve racing and instead it concentrates on performing acrobatic stunts while jumping motocross bikes.<br/>A rider would buy a child's minibike, usually a Honda CRF 50 or Kawasaki KLX110, and apply all the necessary upgrades and modifications to build a competitive pit bike.<br/>The intense competition over rugged terrain led to technical improvements in motorcycles.<br/>During the 1930s the sport grew in popularity, especially in Britain where teams from the Birmingham Small Arms Company (BSA), Norton, Matchless, Rudge, and AJS competed in the events.<br/>More recently, they have been used in races held on either supercross or motocross tracks.<br/>Freestyle motocross (FMX) events where riders are judged on their jumping and aerial acrobatic skills have gained popularity, as has supermoto, where motocross machines race both on tarmac and off-road.<br/>Motocross sidecars are purpose built frames that resemble an ordinary motocross-cycle with a flat platform to stand on attached to either side and a handlebar at waist height to hold on to.<br/><br/><br/><strong>defying stunts</strong><strong>: </strong>The show features James doing death defying stunts.<br/>Professional daredevil, Rodman Law, was a trick parachutist known to thousands for climbing the side of buildings and parachuting out aeroplanes and off of tall base objects like the Statue of Liberty.<br/>This acrobatic discipline required long training in the ring and perfect body control to present a sensational performance to the public.<br/>Critics at the time claimed it to be the most spectacular daredevil thrill comedy.<br/>These new professionals were not only driven to create visual impact, but also perform seemingly impossible feats in a safe and repeatable manner.<br/>Other Hong Kong action movie stars who became known for performing elaborate stunts include Chan's Peking Opera School friends Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao, as well as \"girls with guns\" stars such as Michelle Yeoh and Moon Lee.<br/>Some people act as both stunt performers and daredevils at various parts of their career.<br/>But much like their circus-based predecessors, these actors/stuntmen were not specifically trained to perform stunts, but instead learned through trial and error.<br/>There is maximum risk when the stunts are performed in front of a live audience.<br/>Dar Robinson invented the decelerator during this period, which used dragline cables rather than airbags for stunts that called for a jump from high places.<br/><br/><br/><strong>land vehicle</strong><strong>: </strong>Many pedalo boats also use paddle wheels for propulsion.<br/>The largest vehicle in the world, the Bagger 288, is propelled by continuous tracks.<br/>In 200 CE, Ma Jun built a south-pointing chariot, a vehicle with an early form of guidance system.<br/>Since then, the propeller has been tested on many terrestrial vehicles, including the Schienenzeppelin train and numerous cars.<br/>The ZiL-2906 was a Soviet-designed screw-propelled vehicle designed to retrieve cosmonauts from the Siberian wilderness.<br/>Boats use similar devices called sea anchors to maintain stability in rough seas.<br/>Pulse jets are still occasionally used in amateur experiments.<br/>Because they can produce thrust on both land and water, they are commonly used on all-terrain vehicles.<br/>With the advent of modern technology, the pulse detonation engine has become practical and was successfully tested on a Rutan VariEze.<br/>The B-52 Stratofortress has a special arrangement in which all four main wheels can be angled.<br/><br/><br/><strong>motorcycle</strong><strong>: </strong>Chater-Lea produced variants of these world-beating sports models and became popular among racers at the Isle of Man TT.<br/>Adventurous people are drawn to these bikes, and this group are more prone to be involved in crashes.<br/>NSU and Moto Guzzi were in the vanguard of this development, both producing very radical designs well ahead of their time.<br/>It is not uncommon for riders to transport multiple passengers or large goods aboard small motorcycles and scooters simply because there is no better alternative.<br/>A Norwegian study has looked at the reasons behind motorcycle death accidents.<br/>Recent years have seen an increase in the popularity of motorcycles elsewhere.<br/>Moto Guzzi produced competitive race machines, and until the end of 1957 had a succession of victories.<br/>and those involved in customizing their vehicles in various different styles.<br/>Some organisations

permitted to change their minds about choosing \"truth\" or \"dare\" after having had the slip of paper read out to them.<br/>Players are given the choice between answering a question truthfully, or performing a \"double dare\", both of which are played by both players.<br/>Dare (band), a band fronted by Darren Wharton.<br/>The questioner then selects a random slip from that pile and reads it out - either asking the answerer a question or requiring that they perform a daring forfeit.<br/>Players must perform the dare they are given, or truthfully answer the question asked.<br/>Or, instead of the truths or dares being on slips of paper, the questioner comes up with a truth or dare on the spot.<br/>A Christmas game, in which the commander bids their subjects to answer a question which is

who hit a gate with a glancing blow was saved by the helmet.<br/>Lawrence (known as Lawrence of Arabia) had a crash on a Brough Superior SS100 on a narrow road near his cottage near Wareham.<br/>The chin bar of those helmets offer real protection and they can be used in the \"open\" position while riding.<br/>The Snell Memorial Foundation recently certified a flip-up helmet for the first time.<br/>The visor allows the rider to dip his or her head and provide further protection from flying debris during off-road riding.<br/>Although black helmets are popular among motorcyclists, one study determined they offer the least visibility to motorists.<br/>Cairns' research led to the increased use of crash helmets by both military and civilian motorcyclists.<br/>Some British gamekeepers during the 18th and 19th centuries wore helmets made of straw bound together with cut bramble.<br/>He presented the design to the Auto-Cycle Union where it was initially condemned, but later converted

chinstrap and removing the helmet, making them popular among motor officers.<br/><br/><br/><strong>evel knievel</strong><strong>: </strong>Robbie Knievel continued into adulthood to perform as a professional motorcycle daredevil.<br/>Throughout his daredevil career, Knievel was known for his sensational leather jumpsuits that were compared to the jumpsuits worn by Elvis Presley.<br/>Knievel's daredevil show broke up after the Barstow performance because injuries prevented him from performing.<br/>The series, inspired by his popularity, featured stunt motorcyclists.<br/>Knievel briefly used a Honda 250cc motorcycle to jump a crate of rattlesnakes and two mountain lions, his first known jump.<br/>To keep his name in the news, Knievel proposed his biggest stunt ever, a motorcycle jump across the Grand Canyon.<br/>Knievel would preach an anti-drug message to children and adults before each of his stunts.<br/>Over the course of his career, he attempted more than 75 ramp-to-ramp motorcycle jumps.<br/>The jump took place 33 years after his father, Evel Knievel, made daredevil history by jumping over 14 Greyhound buses at Kings Island.<br/>\"Evel Knievel: Motorcycle daredevil famed for his bone-breaking jumps (Obituary)\".<br/><br/><br/><strong>helmet</strong><strong>: </strong>Some British gamekeepers during the 18th and 19th centuries wore helmets made of straw bound

variety of projects.<br/>I\u2019m not bitter about it, but I lost a lot of money.<br/>After searching for a record label and a name for the project, Hamilton was urged by Jimmy Iovine of Interscope to release the new project under the established Helmet moniker, to which Interscope held the rights.<br/>Race car helmets include a head and neck support system that keeps the helmet (and head) attached to the body in severe collisions.<br/>In the early days of the automobile, some motorists also adopted this style of headgear, and early football helmets were also made of leather.<br/>I love to air

Ornamento contains close to a quarter of a million ornate letters, ornaments, borders, musical notation, diagrams, and illustrations drawn from Iberian print before 1701.<br/>In the Late Antique period both came into common use in Italy, the initials usually were set in the left margin (as in the third example below), as though to cut them off from the rest of the text, and about twice as tall as the other letters.<br/>The decoration of insular initials, especially large ones, was generally abstract and geometrical, or featured animals in patterns.<br/>An initial is often several lines

organic foods are also usually not processed using irradiation, industrial solvents or synthetic food additives.<br/>Unfortunately, this promotes obesity in adults and children alike.<br/>At the simplest level this may involve washing, cutting, trimming, or adding other foods or ingredients, such as spices.<br/>Sausages are also amenable to varied readily available ingredients, and they themselves tend to contain offal and grains.<br/>In the western world, finger foods are often either appetizers (hors d'\u0153uvres) or entree/main course items.<br/>Many campers use a combination of these foods.<br/>To address these needs, camping food is often made up of either freeze-dried, precooked or dehydrated ingredients.<br/>These meals contain pre-cooked foods in retort

K.<br/><br/><br/><strong>yellow bus</strong><strong>: </strong>It is regularly used to transport students to and from school or school-related activities, but not including a charter bus or transit bus.<br/>Within the educational system, the design is primarily used for extracurricular activities requiring bus transportation.<br/>Larger buses may often be derived from school buses (newly purchased or second-hand).<br/>To better protect passengers, MFSABs share the body structure and compartmentalized seating layout of school buses.<br/>The size of a school bus generally limits visibility for both the children and motorists during loading and unloading.<br/>this is commonly achieved with red LEDs.<br/>by 1900, 16 other states would transport students to school.<br/>When loading and unloading students, school buses have the ability to stop traffic, using a system of warning lights and stop arms-a stop sign that is deployed from the bus to stop traffic.<br/>As the use of school buses transports students on a much larger scale than by car (on average, the same as 36 separate automobiles), their use reduces pollution in the same manner as carpooling.<br/>Other farms use unconverted, re-painted, school buses to transport their workforce.<br/><br/><br/><strong>bus</strong><strong>: </strong>In some sparsely populated areas, it is common to use brucks, buses with a cargo area to transport both passengers and cargo at the same time.<br/>This shuttle usage can be as transport between locations, or to and from parking lots.<br/>Buses are often hired for parades or processions.<br/>High specification luxury coaches are often chartered by companies for executive or VIP transport.<br/>Companies such as railroads, construction contractors, and agricultural firms may own buses to transport employees to and from remote job sites.<br/>Tour buses often carry a tour guide, although the driver or a recorded audio commentary may also perform this function.<br/>In some countries, particularly the US and Canada, buses used to transport schoolchildren have evolved into a specific design with specified mandatory features.<br/>These may be day trips or longer excursions incorporating hotel stays.<br/>These are often open-top buses, but can also be regular buses or coaches.<br/>Campaign buses are often specially decorated for a political campaign or other social awareness information campaign, designed to bring a specific message to different areas, or used to transport campaign personnel to local areas/meetings.<br/><br/><br/><strong>would</strong><strong>: </strong>Dare he do it? (\"Does he dare to do it?\").<br/>Would they?.<br/>What shall we wear?Should is sometimes used as a first-person equivalent for would (in its conditional and \"future-in-the-past\" uses), in the same way that shall can replace will.<br/>can he?.<br/>So it was also directed towards people who pass judgments.<br/>Unlike the English modals, however, these verbs are not generally defective.<br/>Note that most of these so-called preterite forms are most often used in the subjunctive mood in the present tense.<br/>However the main auxiliary (which is usually the first modal verb in the sentence), doesn't have to be in the infinitive.<br/>Again like other auxiliaries, modal verbs undergo inversion with their subject, in forming questions and in the other cases described in the article on subject\u2013auxiliary inversion: Could you do this?.<br/>The above negative forms are not usually used in the sense of a factual conclusion.<br/><br/><br/><strong>lumber</strong><strong>: </strong>The seasoning of lumber is typically either kiln- or air-dried.<br/>The length of a board is usually specified separately from the width and depth.<br/>Specifically, it is lumber cut for industrial or wood-packaging use.<br/>Dimensional lumber made from softwood is typically used for construction, while hardwood boards are more commonly used for making cabinets or furniture.<br/>these usually retail in big-box stores and using only a relatively small set of specified lengths.<br/>When large holes are needed, they can typically be made in the webbing only and only in the center third of the span.<br/>Lumber is cut by ripsaw or resaw to create dimensions that are not usually processed by a primary sawmill.<br/>Preserved wood is used most often for railroad ties, utility poles, marine piles, decks, fences and other outdoor applications.<br/>In the United States, pilings are mainly cut from southern yellow pines and Douglas firs.<br/>Defects due to fungi and animals.<br/><br/><br/><strong>grains</strong><strong>: </strong>In North America, farmers commonly deliver their newly harvested grain to a grain elevator, a large storage facility that consolidates the crops of many farmers.<br/>However, some are only grown in cooler highlands, where it ' \"may\" ' be possible to grow multiple crops per year.<br/>Cool-season cereals are well-adapted to temperate climates.<br/>Rice is commonly grown in flooded fields, though some strains are grown on dry land.<br/>Storage facilities should be protected from small grain pests, rodents and birds.<br/>For the past few decades, there has also been increasing interest in perennial grain plants.<br/>In some developing countries, grain in the form of rice, wheat, millet, or maize constitutes a majority of daily sustenance.<br/>Thus, major global commodity markets exist for maize, rice, soybeans, wheat and other grains but not for tubers, vegetables, or other crops.<br/>In this case, the grain is sent to a dehydrating facility, where artificial heat dries it.<br/>The two main types of commercial grain crops are cereals and legumes.<br/><br/><br/><strong>difficult</strong><strong>: </strong>Degree

unprocessed cheeses, heating does not alter its taste or texture.<br/>Processed meat is usually composed of pork or beef, but also poultry, while it can also contain offal or meat by-products such as blood.<br/>It is typically made from a blend of cheeses, most often Colby and cheddar.<br/>Processed cheese is often sold in blocks, pressurized cans, and packs of individual slices, often separated by wax paper, or with each slice individually wrapped by machine.<br/>Such products tend to be classified as \"cheese food\", \"cheese spread\", or \"cheese product\" (depending primarily on the amount of cheese, moisture, and milkfat present in the final product).<br/>Processed cheese typically contains around 50-60% traditional cheese.<br/>In the United Kingdom, processed cheese is typically sold in individually wrapped slices, often referred to as \"singles\", or in foil-wrapped portions.<br/>Nitrate and nitrite are consumed from plant foods as well as animal foods, with 80% of a typical person's nitrate consumption coming from vegetables, especially leafy and root vegetables such as spinach and beets.<br/>Pasteurized process cheese can be made from a single cheese, or a blend of several cheeses.<br/>patent covering a new method of processing cheese, which halted the maturation process.<br/><br/><br/><strong>people</strong><strong>: </strong>states, the \"people\" are judged to be the sovereign, even as in the United Kingdom and other dependencies of the British Crown, criminal prosecutions are typically brought in the name of the Crown.<br/>Various states govern or claim to govern in the name of the people.<br/>A People's Republic is typically a Marxist or socialist one-party state that claims to govern on behalf of the people even if it in practice often turns out to be a dictatorship.<br/>Other states, such as Indiana, typically refer to themselves as the State in case captions and legal process.<br/>The political theory underlying this format is that criminal prosecutions are brought in the name of the sovereign.<br/>National identity.<br/>Outside the United States, criminal trials in Ireland and the Philippines are prosecuted in the name of the people of their respective states.<br/>states, including California, Illinois, and New York, use this style.<br/>Republicanism.<br/>In politics.<br/><br/><br/><strong>sugar</strong><strong>: </strong>In later years, granulated sugar was more usually sold in bags.<br/>After this an \"all-consuming passion for sugar.<br/>They are used for dusting foods and in baking and confectionery.<br/>In its culinary use, exposing sugar to heat causes caramelization.<br/>The sugar may be transported in bulk to the country where it will be used and the refining process often takes place there.<br/>Maltose may be produced by malting grain.<br/>In the Indian subcontinent, the Middle East and China, sugar became a staple of cooking and desserts.<br/>Other varieties are produced from date fruits or from palm sap, rather than sugarcane juice.<br/>The Portuguese took sugar cane to Brazil.<br/>Refined sugar is purer (ICUMSA below 300) than raw sugar (ICUMSA over 1,500).<br/><br/><br/><strong>transport</strong><strong>: </strong>Aviation is able to quickly transport people and limited amounts of cargo over longer distances, but incurs high costs and energy use.<br/>Propulsion is commonly provided by a locomotive, that hauls a series of unpowered cars, that can carry passengers or freight.<br/>Relocation of travelers and cargo are the most common uses of transport.<br/>The transport of a person or of cargo may involve one mode or several of the modes, with the latter case being called inter-modal or multi-modal transport.<br/>Animal-powered transport is the use of working animals for the movement of people and commodities.<br/>First they provided a highly efficient network for shipping freight and passengers across a large national market.<br/>A vehicle is a non-living device that is used to move people and goods.<br/>Typical bulk cargo includes coal, ore, grains and liquids.<br/>Although the primary purpose of the line was to carry coal, it also carried passengers.<br/>Terminals may be used both for interchange of passengers and cargo and for maintenance.<br/><br/><br/><strong>walking people</strong><strong>: </strong>For human walking, gross cost of transport is U-shaped.<br/>Although many people are capable of walking at speeds upwards of 2.<br/>Tetrapod gaits are typically used at medium speeds and are also very stable.<br/>Everyday situations often change the value of time.<br/>and for others the physical, sporting and endurance aspect is more important.<br/>For example, elderly people or people suffering from osteoarthritis must walk more slowly.<br/>Net cost of transport reaches a minimum at about 1.05 m/s (3.8 km/h.<br/>Beach walking can be developed on compact sand or non-compact sand.<br/>Many people tend to walk at about 1.<br/>Running humans and animals may have contact periods greater than 50% of a gait cycle when rounding corners, running uphill or carrying loads.<br/><br/><br/>",

wines, but some of the less strong fortified white wines, such as Pedro Xim\u00e9nez sherry and Muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise, are regarded as honorary dessert wines.<br/>Desserts are a standard staple in restaurant menus, with different degrees of variety.<br/>Dulce de leche is a very common confection in Argentina.<br/>In English-speaking countries, many dessert recipes are based on gelatin with

embody the golden age of baseball.<br/>The stadium is also noted for having the best hitter's background in the American League.<br/>A baseball field can be referred to as a diamond.<br/>The parks were built to hold baseball as well as football, soccer, and other sports.<br/>It was viewed as obsolete only a year into its life.<br/>For example, the 4 retractable-roof parks built in the United States during the retro era are also considered to be retro-modern ballparks.<br/>As a result, it is not generally considered to be a retractable-roof facility.<br/>New \"retro\" parks, which try to recapture the feel of the jewel box parks, are often designed to have these quirks.<br/>The field itself is graced by a distinctive dirt strip between home plate and the pitching mound.<br/>Such tall fences are often used to stop easy home runs in a section of the ballpark where the distances from home are shorter, or where there is little space between the field and the street beyond.<br/><br/><br/><strong>baseball</strong><strong>: </strong>By the late 19th century, baseball was widely recognized as the national sport of the United States.<br/>The first game in the NL\u2014on Saturday, April 22, 1876 (at the Jefferson Street Grounds, Philadelphia)\u2014is often pointed to as the beginning of MLB.<br/>Writing in 1919, philosopher Morris Raphael Cohen described baseball as America's national religion.<br/>In Asia, baseball is among the most popular sports in Japan and South Korea.<br/>Widely known as America's pastime, baseball is well established in several other countries as well.<br/>Although baseball is a team sport, individual players are often placed under scrutiny and pressure.<br/>The baseball cap has become a ubiquitous fashion item not only in the United States and Japan, but also in countries where the sport itself is not particularly popular, such as the United Kingdom.<br/>Consensus once held that today's baseball is a North American development from the older game rounders, popular among children in Great Britain and Ireland.<br/>Overall, baseball has a large following in the United States.<br/>By early in the 20th century, intercollegiate baseball was Japan's leading sport.<br/><br/><br/><strong>world series</strong><strong>: </strong>The series was promoted and referred to as \"The Championship of the United States\", \"World's Championship Series\", or \"World's Series\" for short.<br/>Most importantly, the now-official and compulsory World Series matches were operated strictly by the National Commission itself, not by the participating clubs.<br/>By the 1990s, baseball was played at a highly skilled level in many countries.<br/>Game 6 of the 1975 World Series is regarded by most as one of the greatest World Series games ever played.<br/>Japanese professional players also have a difficult time coming to the North American leagues.<br/>Afterward, World Series games were frequently scheduled at night, when television audiences were larger.<br/>The Series turned out to indeed have serious consequences for the sport.<br/>1992\u20131993: The World Series enters Canada.<br/>Players, coaches and others associated with the team are generally given World Series rings to commemorate their victory.<br/>As the series is played during the fall season in North America, it is also referred to as the Fall Classic.<br/><br/><br/><strong>men</strong><strong>: </strong>Anthropology has shown that masculinity itself has social status, just like wealth, race and social class.<br/>In Western culture, for example, greater masculinity usually brings greater social status.<br/>To what extent masculinity is biologically or socially influenced is subject to debate.<br/>In all cultures in the past, and still among traditional and non-Western cultures, getting married is the most common and definitive distinction between boyhood and manhood.<br/>The Parsons model was used to contrast and illustrate extreme positions on gender roles.<br/>This difference in the relative amounts of these sex steroids is largely responsible for the physiological differences that distinguish men from women.<br/>In the late 20th century, some qualities traditionally associated with marriage (such as the \"triple Ps\" of protecting, providing, and procreating) were still considered signs of having achieved manhood.<br/>Prior to adulthood, a male human is referred to as a boy (a male child or adolescent).<br/>Like most other male mammals, a man's genome usually inherits an X chromosome from the mother and a Y chromosome from the father.<br/>Although masculinity is socially constructed, some research indicates that some behaviors considered masculine are biologically influenced.<br/><br/><br/><strong>pie</strong><strong>: </strong>therefore it is often said that PIE had a pitch accent.<br/>In the United States of America, there is a popular saying that \"there are few things as American as apple pie\".<br/>The Venetic and  Liburnian languages known from the North Adriatic region are sometimes classified as Italic.<br/>Ancient Greeks are believed to have originated pie pastry.<br/>Frozen pot pies are often sold in individual serving size.<br/>This kind of derivation is likely related to the possessive adjectives, and can be seen as essentially the reverse of it.<br/>This combination, and possibly the name as well, is thought to have been popularized in the mid-1890s in the United States.<br/>In the northern states, pumpkin pie was popular, as pumpkins were plentiful.<br/>The Cornish pasty is an adaptation of the pie to a working man's daily food needs.<br/>In the Midwest, cheese and cream pies were popular, due to the availability of big dairy farms.<br/><br/><br/><strong>apple pie</strong><strong>: </strong>Although eaten in Europe since long before the European colonization of the Americas, apple pie as used in the phrase \"as American as apple pie\" describes something as being \"typically American\".<br/>In the United States of America, there is a popular saying that \"there are few things as American as apple pie\".<br/>Apple pie with cheddar is popular in the American Midwest and New England, particularly in Vermont, where it is considered the state dish.<br/>Ancient Greeks are believed to have originated pie pastry.<br/>Frozen pot pies are often sold in individual serving size.<br/>Apple pie is an unofficial symbol of the United States and one of its signature comfort foods.<br/>Apple pie is often served \u00e0 la mode, that is, topped with ice cream.<br/>In English-speaking countries, apple pie, often classified as a satisfying 'comfort' food, is a dessert of enduring popularity, whether it's eaten hot or cold, on its own or with ice cream, double cream, or custard.<br/>This combination, and possibly the name as well, is thought to have been popularized in the mid-1890s in the United States.<br/>In the north of England, Wensleydale cheese is often used.<br/><br/><br/><strong>batter</strong><strong>: </strong>The practice of beer battering is popular in Australia, New Zealand, the United States, Britain, Ireland, Germany, Iceland and Russia.<br/>Batter is most often used for pancakes, light cakes, and as a coating for fried foods.<br/>Some foods that are commonly beer battered and fried are fish, chips, and onion rings.<br/>All batters work by forming a crisp shell around the food, preventing scorching and retaining flavor and juices.<br/>Batters are used in many cuisines under many names.<br/>Beer is a popular ingredient in batters used to coat foods before frying.<br/>The ideal batter for fried foods is to be thick enough to adhere to the food, but not so thick as to become heavy.<br/>The purpose of using beer is so the bubbles in the beer will add body and lightness to the batter.<br/>Many batters are made by combining dry flours with liquids such as water, milk or eggs.<br/>Batter (baseball), person whose turn it is to face the pitcher.<br/><br/><br/><strong>this sport</strong><strong>: </strong>These trends are seen by many as contrary to the fundamental ethos of sport being carried on for its own sake and for the enjoyment of its participants.<br/>Super Bowl Sunday is a de facto national holiday in America.<br/>The practice of athletic competitions has been criticised by some Christian thinkers as a form of idolatry, in which \"human beings extol themselves, adore themselves, sacrifice themselves and reward themselves.<br/>In the history of Ireland, Gaelic sports were connected with cultural nationalism.<br/>The sport was developed in Spain during the late 1990s and is currently played mainly in Europe.<br/>Sport betting is in some cases severely regulated, and in some cases is central to the sport.<br/>\" Sports are seen by these critics as a manifestation of \"collective pride\" and \"national self-deification\" in which feats of human power are idolized at the expense of divine worship.<br/>Youth sport in the US is a $15 billion industry including equipment up to private coaching.<br/>Nationalism is often evident in the pursuit of sport, or in its reporting: people compete in national teams, or commentators and audiences can adopt a partisan view.<br/>It is common for popular sports to attract large broadcast audiences, leading to rival broadcasters bidding large amounts of money for the rights to show certain fixtures.<br/><br/><br/>", "concept": "<strong>baseball stadium</strong><strong>: </strong>a

deli meat sandwiches, and sweet sandwiches, such as a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.<br/>For example, the phrase jeely piece refers to a jam sandwich.<br/>For example, an ice cream sandwich consists of a layer of ice cream between two layers of cake or biscuit.<br/>However, hot sliced (not ground) beef between two slices of toasted bread is referred to as a steak sandwich:  it is the sliced loaf bread that distinguishes the steak sandwich from a burger.<br/>The sandwich began as a portable finger food in the Western world, though over time it has become prevalent worldwide.<br/>The sandwich's popularity in Spain and England increased dramatically during the nineteenth century, when the rise of industrial society and the working classes made fast, portable, and inexpensive meals essential.<br/>The modern concept of a sandwich using slices of bread as found within the West can arguably be traced to 18th-century Europe.<br/>In the UK and Australia, the term sandwich is more narrowly defined than in the US: it refers usually to an item which uses sliced bread from a loaf.<br/>during that decade sandwich bars also became an important form of eating establishment in western Holland, typically serving liver and salt beef sandwiches.<br/>Similar usage applies in other Spanish-speaking cultures, such as Mexico, where the word torta is also used for

International in 2015.<br/>she was stripped of her title and Dolly Mihas was declared winner.<br/>^Note 1  : Punjab is the only state which had placed in all four of the regional editions of the pageant till day.<br/>It is organised by Femina, a women's magazine published by The Times Group.<br/>It is a shortened form of mistress, and departed from misses/missus which became used to signify marital attachment in the 18th and 19th centuries.<br/><br/><br/><strong>bacon</strong><strong>: </strong>It is lower in fat and food energy than bacon, but may be used in a similar manner (such as in a BLT sandwich).<br/>Different cuts of pork are used for making bacon depending on local preferences.<br/>Bacon bits are made from small, crumbled pieces of bacon.<br/>Hot bacon sandwiches are a popular cafe dish in the UK and Ireland, and are anecdotally recommended as a hangover cure.<br/>The inclusion of skin with a cut of bacon, known as the 'bacon rind', varies, though is less common in the English-speaking world.<br/>Vegetarian bacon is usually made from marinated strips of textured soy protein or tempeh.<br/>Sodium polyphosphates, such as sodium triphosphate, may also be added to make the product easier to slice and to reduce spattering when the bacon is pan-fried.<br/>Tatws Pum Munud is a traditional Welsh stew, made with sliced potatoes, vegetables and smoked bacon.<br/>Fried or grilled bacon rashers are included in the \"traditional\" full breakfast.<br/>it is largely similar in appearance to pork bacon except for the darker

vessel along with spices (usually dill and garlic), water and salt.<br/>A \"kosher\" dill pickle is not necessarily kosher in the sense that it has been prepared in accordance with Jewish dietary law.<br/>Rather, it is a pickle made in the traditional manner of Jewish New York City pickle makers, with generous addition of garlic and dill to a natural salt brine.<br/>The fermentation process is dependent on the Lactobacillus bacteria that naturally occur on the skin of a growing cucumber.<br/>This is also done in Japan, where it is referred to as \"stick pickle\" (\u4e00\u672c\u6f2c, ippon-tsuke).<br/>Pickled cucumbers are often part of mixed pickles.<br/>The more salt added, the more sour the cucumbers become.<br/><br/><br/><strong>a pb</strong><strong>: </strong>The peanut butter in PB Max was sweetened with sugar and combined with hydrogenated vegetable oil to prevent separation.<br/>According to former Mars executive Alfred Poe, PB Max was discontinued due to the Mars family's distaste for peanut butter, despite $50 million in sales.<br/>Pb is the chemical symbol for the element lead.<br/>Early television commercials for PB Max declared that the \"PB\" in its name didn't stand for things such as piggy banks, polka band, portly ballerina, platinum blonde, penguin black-belt, pig basketball, plow boy, pure bliss, parachuting buffalo, or pink baboon \u2014 but

sandwich.<br/>The sandwich is often cut in half to make it easier to handle.<br/><br/><br/><strong>cutting board</strong><strong>: </strong>Hard cutting boards can, however, be used for food preparation tasks that do not require a sharp knife, like cutting cheese or making sandwiches.<br/>Once the bamboo is pliable, a cutting board can be produced from multiple pieces by lamination.<br/>Oak is also not a common cutting board material due to its relatively large pore size.<br/>Regardless of the material, regular maintenance of a cutting board is important.<br/>There

European cake-making techniques with locally grown ingredients that created the pandan-flavoured cake.<br/>However, the distinct ingredient is the use of pandan leaf, which give the cake its distinct green colouration.<br/>The cakes are not always made with the leaf juice, as they can be flavoured with Pandanus extract, in which case colouring is only added if a green colouration is desired.<br/>This has led to a reaction in Indonesia that regarded the pandan cake, locally known as kue bolu pandan as theirs.<br/>In Singapore pandan cake was popularized especially by one of the popular bakery in the city.<br/>The marzipan overlay is usually green, sprinkled with powdered sugar, and often decorated with a pink marzipan rose.<br/>The other variant are actually derived from

pancakes called blinis which are frequently eaten with caviar.<br/><br/><br/><strong>jelly</strong><strong>: </strong>The basic ingredients of jelly beans include sugar, tapioca or corn syrup, and pectin or starch.<br/>The colors of jelly beans often correspond with a fruit and a \"spiced\" flavor.<br/>The song \"Jelly Bean (He's a Curbstone Cutie)\" was made popular during the 1940s by Phil Harris.<br/>It was not until July 5, 1905, that jelly beans were mentioned in the Chicago Daily News.<br/>It has been claimed that jelly beans were first mentioned during 1861, when Boston confectioner William Schrafft urged people to send his jelly beans to soldiers during the American Civil War.<br/>Assortments of \"spiced\" jellybeans and gumdrops are also available, which include a similar number of spice and mint flavors.<br/>The confection is primarily made of sugar and sold in a wide variety of colors and flavors.<br/>The advertisement publicized bulk jelly beans sold by volume for nine cents per pound, according to the book The Century in Food: America's Fads and Favorites.<br/>Within the Mexican drug cartel, the word \"Jelly-Bean\" is often used as a code word for

ingredient itself consists of more than one ingredient (such as the cookie pieces which are a part of \"cookies and cream\" flavor ice cream), then that ingredient is listed by what percentage of the total product it occupies, with its own ingredients displayed next to it in brackets.<br/>This leads to complications in labelling.<br/>For example, in cooking, recipes specify which ingredients are used to prepare a specific dish.<br/>An ingredient is a substance that forms part of a mixture (in a general sense).<br/>Patients often have difficulty identifying the active ingredients in their medication, and are often unaware of the notion of an active ingredient.<br/>However, standardization has not been achieved yet: different companies use different markers, or different levels of the same markers, or different methods of testing for marker compounds.<br/>For instance, St John's wort is often standardized to the hypericin which is now known not to be the \"active ingredient\" for antidepressant use.<br/>The term constituent is often used to refer to substances that constitute the tissue of living beings.<br/>Many herbalists believe that the active ingredient in a plant is the plant itself.<br/>During formulation development, the excipients are chosen carefully so that the active ingredient can reach the target site in the body at the desired rate and

company in New York.<br/>Green Bus may refer to:.<br/>.<br/><br/><br/><strong>engine</strong><strong>: </strong>This type of engine is used to move heavy loads and drive machinery.<br/>Today most electric power is provided by steam turbines.<br/>Another means of supplying lower-pressure boiler feed water is an injector, which uses a steam jet usually supplied from the boiler.<br/>Some motors are powered by potential or kinetic energy, for example some funiculars, gravity plane and ropeway conveyors have used the energy from moving water or rocks, and some clocks have a weight that falls under gravity.<br/>Other forms of potential energy include compressed gases (such as pneumatic motors), springs (clockwork motors) and elastic bands.<br/>They may be powered by direct current (for example a battery powered portable device or motor vehicle), or by alternating current from a central electrical distribution grid.<br/>Historic military siege engines included large catapults, trebuchets, and (to some extent) battering rams were powered by potential energy.<br/>A hydraulic motor derives its power from a pressurized liquid.<br/>The most useful instrument for analyzing the performance of steam engines is the steam engine indicator.<br/>Non-thermal motors usually are powered by a chemical reaction, but are not heat engines.<br/><br/><br/><strong>power</strong><strong>:

road transport involved animals, such as horses (domesticated in the 4th or the 3rd millennium BCE), oxen (from about 8000 BCE).<br/>Also, a train can be powered by horses, cables, gravity, pneumatics and gas turbines.<br/>The most common road vehicle is the automobile.<br/>The aircraft is the second fastest method of transport, after the rocket.<br/>Cable transport is a broad mode where vehicles are pulled by cables instead of an internal power source.<br/>this is most commonly done through a steam engine, combustion engine, electric motor, a jet engine or a rocket, though other means of propulsion also exist.<br/>Early water transport was accomplished with ships that were either rowed or used the wind for propulsion, or a combination of the two.<br/>It is possible to provide door-to-door service only by road transport.<br/>Some ships, such as submarines, use nuclear power to produce the steam.<br/>The locomotive can be powered by steam, diesel or by electricity supplied

early engines was a relatively volatile hydrocarbon obtained from coal gas.<br/>The solution to the expansion of storage, transportation, finances, and production was the creation of the Defense Supplies Corporation on 19 September 1940.<br/>The first internal combustion engines suitable for use in transportation applications, so-called Otto engines, were developed in Germany during the last quarter of the 19th century.<br/>Also, the use of natural gasoline increased greatly.<br/>The specific gravity of gasoline is from 0.<br/>the relevant metric for diesel engines is the cetane number.<br/>Virtually all of Germany's aviation gasoline came from synthetic oil plants that hydrogenated coals and coal tars.<br/>Most gasoline sold in Sweden has 5\u201315% ethanol added.<br/>The price of gasoline in Europe is typically higher than that in the U.<br/><br/><br/><strong>electricity</strong><strong>: </strong>Other forms of electricity generation used in niche applications include the triboelectric effect, the piezoelectric effect, the thermoelectric effect, and betavoltaics.<br/>Most electric generation is driven by heat engines.<br/>His method, still used today, is for electricity to be generated by the movement of a loop of wire, or Faraday disc, between the poles of a magnet.<br/>Almost all commercial electrical generation is done using electromagnetic induction, in which mechanical energy forces a generator to rotate:.<br/>Currently, most electrochemical power comes from batteries.<br/>The SI unit of power is the watt, one joule per second.<br/>A small proportion of electric power distributed by utilities is provided by batteries.<br/>Almost all commercial electrical power on Earth is generated with a turbine, driven by wind, water, steam or burning gas.<br/>This is the most used form for generating electricity and is based on Faraday's law.<br/>Other energy sources include solar photovoltaics and geothermal power.<br/><br/><br/><strong>diesel</strong><strong>: </strong>Many different methods of injection can be used.<br/>On bigger ships, high-speed diesel engines are often used for powering electric generators.<br/>The highest power output of high-speed diesel engines is approximately 5 MW.<br/>Four-stroke engines on ships are usually used to power an electric generator.<br/>An additional advantage of the diesel engine is the lack of fuel during the compression stroke.<br/>The popularity of diesel-powered passenger cars in markets such as India, South Korea and Japan is increasing (as of 2018).<br/>A supercharger is powered mechanically by the engine's crankshaft, while a turbocharger is powered by the engine exhaust.<br/>Submarines are usually diesel-electric.<br/>A necessary component of all diesel engines is a mechanical or electronic governor which regulates the torque of the engine and thus idling speed and maximum speed by controlling the rate of fuel delivery.<br/>Stationary diesel engines are commonly used for electricity generation, but also for powering refrigerator compressors, or other types of compressors or pumps.<br/><br/><br/>",

world are already experiencing stress on water availability (or water scarcity).<br/>Although most aquatic organisms have a limited ability to regulate their osmotic balance and therefore can only live within a narrow range of salinity, diadromous fish have the ability to migrate between fresh water and saline water bodies.<br/>In some cases this acid rain results in pollution of lakes and rivers.<br/>Fresh water falling as mist, rain or snow contains materials dissolved from the atmosphere and material from the sea and land over which the rain bearing clouds have traveled.<br/>Currently, as energy is limited the coefficient of resource input to output, thus process efficiency is the determinant.<br/>In Australia, over-abstraction of fresh water for intensive

with potential values of several thousand dollars.<br/>The first international body was the International Cycling Association (ICA), established by an English schoolteacher named Henry Sturmey, the founder of Sturmey-Archer.<br/>Among the best-known ultramarathons is the Race Across America (RAAM), a coast-to-coast non-stop, single-stage race in which riders cover approximately 3,000 miles (4,800 km) in about a week.<br/>As an example, some prominent professional teams of the last 30 years have been Team Telekom, Team Jumbo\u2013Visma, ONCE, Mapei and Lampre.<br/>The two most common competition formats are mass start events, where riders start simultaneously (though sometimes with a handicap) and race to set finish point.<br/>Several variations of road bikes include:.<br/>\" The preeminent site on the golden era of cycling is Classic Lightweights.<br/>Other cyclists prefer this type of bicycle to those manufactured using modern techniques because they are \"practical,

davidson</strong><strong>: </strong>The Japanese license-holder, Sankyo Seiyaku Corporation, severed its business relations with Harley-Davidson in 1936 and continued manufacturing the VL under the Rikuo name.<br/>The classic Harley-Davidson engines are V-twin engines, with a 45\u00b0 angle between the cylinders.<br/>the oldest one, founded in 1928, is in Prague.<br/>The models most commonly upgraded in such a fashion are the Ultra Classic Electra Glide, which has been selected for CVO treatment every year from 2006 to the present, and the Road King, which was selected in 2002, 2003, 2007, and 2008.<br/>By 1920, Harley-Davidson was the largest motorcycle manufacturer in the world, with 28,189 machines produced and dealers in 67 countries.<br/>Harley-Davidson is noted for a style of customization that gave rise to the chopper motorcycle style.<br/>One of only two American cycle manufacturers to survive the Great Depression, Harley-Davidson again produced large numbers of motorcycles for the US Army in World War II and resumed civilian production afterwards, producing a range of large V-twin motorcycles that were successful both on racetracks and for private buyers.<br/>The stated reason was to focus on the Harley-Davidson brand.<br/>After 1913, the majority of bikes produced by Harley-Davidson were V-Twin models.<br/>One possible reason for the delayed availability in the United States was the fact that Harley-Davidson had to obtain the \"XR1200\" naming rights from Storz Performance, a Harley customizing shop in Ventura, Calif.<br/><br/><br/><strong>schwinn</strong><strong>: </strong>It became the dominant manufacturer of American bicycles through most of the 20th century.<br/>One example was Peugeot, which won several Tour de France victories using race bikes with frames occasionally constructed by small race-oriented framebuilders such as Masi, suitably repainted in Team Peugeot colors.<br/>The new company produced a series of well-regarded mountain bikes bearing the Schwinn name, called the Homegrown series.<br/>By 1971, United States government councils had objected to Schwinn's marketing practices.<br/>Schwinn sells essentially two lines of bicycles.<br/>Schwinn developed strong trading relationships with two Japanese bicycle manufacturers in particular, Bridgestone and National/Panasonic.<br/>After a series of production cuts and labor force reductions, Schwinn was able to restructure its operations.<br/>At the time, most bicycle manufacturers in the United States sold in bulk to department stores, which in turn sold them as store brand models.<br/>Faced with a downward sales spiral, Schwinn went into bankruptcy in 1992.<br/>By 1965, a host of American and foreign manufacturers were offering their own version of the Sting-Ray.<br/><br/><br/><strong>man</strong><strong>: </strong>Another significant hormone in sexual differentiation is the

the outside blocker, increasing the chance for the attacking team to make a point.<br/>Similarly, teams might use a Serving Specialist to sub out a poor server.<br/>Most often, the situation involves a team using a right side player with a big block who must be subbed out in the back row because they aren't able to effectively play backcourt defence.<br/>Additionally, if the ball is delivered full toss above the waist the batsman receives a free hit.<br/>The main objective is to make it land inside the court.<br/>Also, if the ball did hit the stumps, the batsman could afford to steal single runs (a bye) because the ball is normally considered a dead ball.<br/>The fault lies with the fielding side, and the advantage is to the batting side.<br/>That is, the libero can only serve for one

separate \"broadband routers,\" placed between the modem and their network, to perform these functions.<br/>It provided full-duplex service at 300 bit/s over normal phone lines.<br/>These are commonly used in fiber to the home installations, installed inside or outside a house to convert the optical medium to a copper Ethernet interface, after which a router or gateway is often installed to perform authentication, routing, NAT, and other typical consumer internet functions, in addition to \"triple play\" features such as telephony and television service.<br/>This eventually allowed computers to send and receive fax images.<br/>They transmit information that is modulated onto a carrier frequency to allow many wireless communication links to work simultaneously on different frequencies.<br/>This allows much higher frequencies, and therefore much faster speeds.<br/>This allowed third-party (non-Bell) manufacturers to sell modems utilizing an acoustic coupler.<br/>It employs the most powerful coding techniques available at the time, including channel encoding and shape encoding.<br/><br/><br/><strong>wireless</strong><strong>: </strong>The cell phone connects to the base system station which then connects to the operation and support station.<br/>it then connects to the switching station where the call is transferred to where it needs to go.<br/>Wireless networks are simple and require as few as one single wireless access point connected directly to the Internet via a router.<br/>It is often used in cities to connect networks in two or more buildings without installing a wired link.<br/>For example, both Bluetooth radio and invisible infrared light provides a WPAN for interconnecting a headset to a laptop.<br/>These networks can be used to connect branch offices of business or as a public Internet access system.<br/>wireless headphones, keyboards, and printers can also be linked to a computer via wireless using technology such as Wireless USB

Internet.<br/><br/><br/><strong>screen</strong><strong>: </strong>This effectively fills the mesh openings with ink and moves the ink reservoir to the front of the screen.<br/>It adds variety to the design and gives it that natural soft feel.<br/>This serves to protect the 'pallet' from any unwanted ink leaking through the screen and potentially staining the 'pallet' or transferring unwanted ink onto the next substrate.<br/>This hardens the emulsion in the exposed areas but leaves the unexposed parts soft.<br/>The resulting roller rotates at the same speed as the web in a roll-to-roll machine.<br/>This causes the ink to wet the substrate and be pulled out of the mesh apertures as the screen springs back after the blade has passed.<br/>This makes it useful for some of the techniques of printing solar cells, electronics etc.<br/>The overlay is placed over the screen, and then exposed with a light source containing ultraviolet light in the 350-420 nanometer spectrum.<br/>The ink that is in the mesh opening is pumped or squeezed by capillary action to the substrate in a controlled and prescribed amount, i.<br/>Ink is placed on top of the screen, and a floodbar is used to push the ink through the holes in the mesh.<br/><br/><br/><strong>electronics</strong><strong>: </strong>It uses ultrasonic waves that are silent to humans but cause mosquitoes to fly away.<br/>Two tiny plastic arms fold out from the end of the keyboard to support a tablet or smartphone and it can toggle between two different Bluetooth-connected devices at a time.<br/>They later renamed the 2011 Internet televisions to \"LG Smart TV\" when more interactive television features were added, that enable the audience to receive information from the Internet while watching conventional TV programming.<br/>Components are generally intended to be connected together, usually by being soldered to a printed circuit board (PCB), to create an electronic circuit with a particular function (for example an amplifier, radio receiver, or oscillator).<br/>The ability of electronic devices to act as switches makes digital information-processing possible.<br/>It revolutionized the electronics industry, becoming the most widely used electronic device in the world.<br/>LG attracts a large attendance of fans and to much of their enjoyment, took third place in the league.<br/>HomeChat employs LINE, the mobile messenger app from Korean company 'Naver', to let homeowners communicate, control, monitor and share content with LG's smart appliances.<br/>It uses active devices to control electron

insects, can use puddles as a source of essential moisture or for bathing.<br/>Puddles on roads.<br/>In a behaviour known as puddling they seek out the damp mud that can be found around the edge of the puddles.<br/>Puddles like this are common on kitchen floors.<br/>Many butterfly species and some other insects, but particularly male butterflies, need puddles for nutrients they can contain, such as salts and amino acids.<br/>Natural puddles and wildlife.<br/>Swallows use the damp loam which gathers in puddles as a form of cement to help to build their nests.<br/>A children's nursery rhyme records the story of Doctor Foster and his encounter with a puddle in Gloucester.<br/>A similar legend, of a young boy drowning in a puddle that formed in a pothole in a major street in the early

this room, people who had business with the local landowner or his household could meet.<br/>It is like a movie made by an alien who has never seen a movie, but has had movies thoroughly explained to him.<br/>When Mark arrives, he is revealed to have shaved his beard, and the camera slowly zooms in on his face while dramatic music plays on the

beam as it traveled from the source, to the mirror and then returned to its origin.<br/>There are many sources of light.<br/>He questioned that sight is the result of a beam from the eye, for he asks how one sees the stars immediately, if one closes one's eyes, then opens them at night.<br/>The forces of pressure exerted on the two sides are equal if the plate is at rest.<br/>Hence, as the resultant of the two forces, there remains a force that counteracts the motion of the plate and that increases with the velocity of the plate.<br/>The refractive quality of lenses is frequently used to manipulate light in order to change the apparent size of images.<br/>10,340 degrees Fahrenheit) peaks in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum when plotted in wavelength units and roughly 44% of sunlight energy that reaches the ground is visible.<br/>However, the energy imparted by the waves is absorbed at single locations the way particles are absorbed.<br/>The main source of light on Earth is the Sun.<br/><br/><br/><strong>fly</strong><strong>: </strong>Later, the gods are said to swarm \"like flies\" around the hero Utnapishtim's offering.<br/>The ocelli are concerned in the detection of changes in light intensity, enabling the fly to react swiftly to the approach of an object.<br/>They are protected from the ants by imitating chemical odours given by ant colony members.<br/>However, consumers are opposed to the inclusion of insects in their food, and the use of insects in animal feed remains illegal in areas such as the European Union.<br/>This leads to flies having more reproduction abilities than most insects, and much quicker.<br/>In some females, the sclerites are rolled into a flexible, telescopic ovipositor.<br/>This forces the male to lie on his back for his genitalia to remain engaged with those of the female, or the torsion of the male genitals allows the male to mate while remaining upright.<br/>It has been suggested that fly larvae could be used at a large scale as food for farmed chickens, pigs, and fish.<br/>Some plants are pollinated by fungus feeding flies that visit fungus infected male flowers.<br/>Flies that feed on blood have special sensory structures that can detect infrared emissions, and use them to home in on their hosts, and many blood-sucking flies can detect the raised concentration of carbon dioxide that occurs near large animals.<br/><br/><br/><strong>kitchen &amp; dining room table</strong><strong>: </strong>in the Demonstration Kitchen, strip and spot-lighting from a beam focus the attention on the

have negative effects such as glare and heat gain.<br/>Window sills slant outward to drain water away from the inside of the building.<br/>This type of window allows for natural daylight and moonlight.<br/>Passive solar windows allow light and solar energy into a building while minimizing air leakage and heat loss.<br/>Some window coverings control solar heat gain and glare.<br/>Picture windows provide an unimpeded view, as if framing a picture.<br/>Such a design allows considerable solar light and heat penetration due to the most commonly occurring incidence of sun angles.<br/>A fixed window is a window that cannot be opened, whose function is limited to allowing light to enter (unlike an unfixed window, which can open and close).<br/>In passive solar building design, an extended eave is typically used to control the amount of solar light and heat entering the window(s).<br/>Photovoltaic windows not only provide a clear view and illuminate rooms, but also convert sunlight to electricity for the building.<br/><br/><br/><strong>sun</strong><strong>: </strong>Simple filters made of darkened glass allow the full intensity of sunlight to pass through if they break, endangering the observer's eyesight.<br/>This would have led to increased absorption of solar energy, thereby compensating for the lower solar output.<br/>It also delivers about 4 milliwatts of sunlight to the retina, slightly heating it and potentially causing damage in eyes that cannot respond properly to the brightness.<br/>The brightness of the Sun can cause pain from looking at it with the naked eye.<br/>The sunlight that is destined for the eyepiece is reflected from an unsilvered surface of a piece of glass.<br/>It was the center of a popular cult among Romans, who would stand at dawn to catch the first rays of sunshine as they prayed.<br/>Only a very small fraction of the incident light is reflected.<br/>It is estimated that the Sun has become 30% brighter in the last 4.<br/>If the glass breaks because of the heat, no light at all is reflected, making the device fail-safe.<br/>It is claimed that even brief glances at the midday Sun through an unfiltered telescope can cause permanent damage.<br/><br/><br/><strong>shade</strong><strong>: </strong>The name apparently stuck when other members of the band noticed that the sun bothered him and he used the brim of a hat to shade his eyes.<br/>Shade (shadow), the blocking of sunlight.<br/>He persuaded a few local musicians, though still reluctant, to join him in creating one of the first jug bands in Memphis.<br/>He lost both the stock and the house shortly after the Great Depression began in 1929.<br/>He was excited by what he heard and felt that bringing this style of music to his hometown of Memphis could be promising.<br/>He credited his mother with teaching him how to play the harmonica, his first instrument.<br/>Shade also performed as an accompanist on Cannon's \"comeback\" album, Walk Right In, recorded by Stax Records in 1963.<br/>He composed many of the band's songs and sang lead vocal on a handful of their recordings.<br/>Blues revivalists found Shade and his old partners still playing together into the early 1960s and released several field recordings under the name of the Memphis Jug Band.<br/>In 2008 a group of musicians based at the Old Town School of Folk Music held a fundraiser and purchased a headstone for his grave.<br/><br/><br/><strong>table</strong><strong>: </strong>There is additionally an internal \"double periodicity\" that splits the shells in half.<br/>This is caused by the filling of the valence shell of the atom.<br/>He was the first person to notice the periodicity of the elements.<br/>The group 1 members are easily cut with a knife.<br/>This also explains why the 3d contraction has a stronger effect on the following elements than the 4d or 5d ones do.<br/>they behave as if they were located on the left side of the table.<br/>They therefore screen the nuclear charge incompletely, and therefore the valence electrons that fill immediately after the completion of such a core subshell are more tightly bound by the nucleus than would be expected.<br/>Hence the non-relativistic Bohr model is inaccurate when applied to such an element.<br/>It is capable of forming alloy-like hydrides, featuring metallic bonding, with some transition metals.<br/>The 3d elements show the opposite effect.<br/><br/><br/><strong>lamp</strong><strong>: </strong>The deep purple glass filters out most of the visible colors of light directly emitted by the mercury-vapor discharge, producing proportionally less visible light compared with UV light.<br/>The fill gas helps determine the electrical characteristics of the lamp, but does not give off light itself.<br/>otherwise, the mercury accumulates at one end of the tube.<br/>Museum artifacts may need protection from UV light to prevent degradation of pigments or textiles.<br/>Lamp fixture design must control light from a long tube instead of a compact globe.<br/>If the lamp does not ignite, an electronic circuit stops the operation of the ballast.<br/>Not all the UV radiation striking the phosphor coating is converted to visible light.<br/>The sputtered material collects on the walls of the tube, darkening it.<br/>This technique has become popular among aquatic gardeners as a cost-effective way to add more light to their aquariums.<br/>Hum is eliminated in lamps with a high-frequency electronic ballast.<br/><br/><br/><strong>curtain</strong><strong>: </strong>Window treatment helps control the ambiance and flow of natural light into the room.<br/>Curtains are often hung on the inside of a building's windows to block the passage of light.<br/>They not only block out the light, but can also serve as an acoustic or thermal dampener.<br/>during the day most sheer fabrics will allow people inside the home to see the outside view while preventing people outside the home from seeing directly into the home.<br/>For instance, at night to aid sleeping, or to stop light from escaping outside the building (stopping people outside from being able to see inside, often for privacy reasons).<br/>They are held out of the way of the window by means of curtain tie-backs.<br/>As a result, when curtains made from uncoated fabrics are closed in an attempt to block out direct sunlight, light will still be visible through the curtain.<br/>However, the fabric itself is typically not thick enough to completely absorb strong light sources.<br/>Curtain liners are used to protect actual curtains from getting wet.<br/>Various architectural structures around the curtain can minimize these air drafts, but usually they are just used for decoration and make rooms feel more cozy.<br/><br/><br/><strong>curtains</strong><strong>: </strong>Window treatment helps control the ambiance and flow of natural light into the room.<br/>Curtains are often hung on

walls, innovatively, were of equal height to the towers.<br/>Usually only the first floor would be vaulted in stone, with the higher storeys supported with timbers.<br/>3 metres) thick, immensely strong, and producing a steady temperature inside the building throughout summer and winter.<br/>first storey was on the surface of the ground, where were cellars and granaries, and great boxes, tuns, casks, and other domestic utensils.<br/>The entrance to the fortress is by means of a bridge, which, rising from the outer side of the moat and supported on posts as it ascends, reches to the top of the mound.<br/>Similarly, the corners of a square keep created dead space that defenders could not fire at, but missile fire in castle sieges was less important until the introduction of the crossbow in the middle of the 12th century, when arrowslits began to be introduced.<br/>were designed to allow very rich men to live in luxury and splendour.<br/>In some cases the entrance stairs were protected by additional walls and a door, producing a forebuilding.<br/>In the 15th century, the protective function of keeps was compromised by improved artillery.<br/><br/><br/><strong>glass</strong><strong>: </strong>Several processes such as toughening can increase the strength of glass.<br/>Glass is also employed as the aperture cover in many solar energy collectors.<br/>They are, therefore, less subject to stress caused by thermal expansion and thus less vulnerable to cracking from thermal shock.<br/>Optical glass typically has a refractive index of 1.<br/>This assumption is incorrect, as once solidified, glass stops flowing.<br/>Many emerging pharmaceuticals are practically insoluble in their crystalline forms.<br/>Usually, the melts are carried out in platinum crucibles to reduce contamination from the crucible material.<br/>Container glass has a lower magnesium oxide and sodium oxide content than flat glass, and a higher Silica, Calcium oxide, and Aluminum oxide content.<br/>As in other amorphous solids, the atomic structure of a glass lacks the long-range periodicity observed in crystalline solids.<br/>Glass is a ubiquitous material in optics by virtue of its ability to refract, reflect, and transmit light.<br/><br/><br/>", "concept": "<strong>curtains</strong><strong>: </strong>curtains are capable of

section is usually referred to as the concertmaster in the US or leader in the UK.<br/>The most common theories are that the chair was an outgrowth of indigenous Chinese furniture, that it evolved from a camp stool imported from Central Asia, that it was introduced to China by Christian missionaries in the seventh century, and that the chair came to China from India as a form of Buddhist monastic furniture.<br/>Hence in some chair designs, the armrest is not continuous to the chair back, but is missing in the elbow area.<br/>The two most relevant anthropometric measurement for chair design is the popliteal height and buttock popliteal length.<br/>for example a designing chair will be used for designers who sit at high easels.<br/>Mass-produced chairs are typically 15\u201317

noble, sincere\"), ultimately from Medieval Latin francus (\"free, exempt from service.<br/>The architecture associated to this era is named Second Empire in English, the term being taken from the Second French Empire.<br/>The etymology of *Frank is uncertain.<br/>Originally applied to the whole Frankish Empire, the name France comes from the Latin Francia, or \"realm of the Franks\".<br/>Three largest financial institutions cooperatively owned by their customers are located in France.<br/>It is traditionally derived from the Proto-Germanic word *frank\u014dn, which translates as \"javelin\" or \"lance\" (the throwing axe of the Franks was known as the francisca), although these weapons may have been named because of their use by the Franks, not the other way around.<br/>This label is

originally meaning \"leisure\" and also \"that in which leisure is employed\", but later \"a group to whom lectures were given, school\".<br/>The term primary school is derived from the French \u00e9cole primaire, which was first used in an English text in 1802.<br/>The term school is rarely used for tertiary education, except for some upper or high schools (German: Hochschule), which describe colleges and universities.<br/>These schools are located in forests outside of the towns and villages, and the space used is solely for these schools.<br/>This terminology extends into research literature.<br/>The use of the term school varies by country, as do the names of the various levels of education within the country.<br/>The number of rooms required can be determined from

appropriate means of measuring the length of a word is by counting its syllables or morphemes.<br/>However, some languages have infixes, which are put inside a word.<br/>These extra words will tend to be added in the word boundaries of the original sentence.<br/>In these languages, words may be considered to be constructed from a number of morphemes.<br/>However, some written words are not minimal free forms as they make no sense by themselves (for example, the and of).<br/>Some words can be controversial, such as slang in formal contexts.<br/>Mandarin Chinese is a very analytic language (with few inflectional affixes), making it unnecessary to delimit words orthographically.<br/>The concept of \"word\" is usually distinguished from that of a morpheme, which is the smallest unit of word which has a meaning, even if it will not stand on its own.<br/>There are several ways to determine where the word boundaries of spoken language should be placed:.<br/>These can be taken as an indication of what constitutes a \"word\" in the opinion of the writers of that language.<br/><br/><br/><strong>red sign</strong><strong>: </strong>The symbol was created by California Department of

are three infield positions that can only effectively be occupied by right-handed players: 2nd base, 3rd base, and shortstop.<br/>In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the first baseman is assigned the number 3.<br/>In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the third baseman is assigned the number 5.<br/>Unless otherwise noted, the specifications discussed in this section refer to those described within the Official Baseball Rules, under which Major League Baseball is played.<br/>Within the game there are positions in which each participating  player can play in.<br/>In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the second baseman is assigned the number 4, and the shortstop 6.<br/>Generally, base runners are not required to follow the baseline.<br/>In some youth leagues and adult recreational leagues, a \"double\" or \"safety\" first base may be used.<br/>However, a base runner's left-right motion is constrained when the defense tries to tag him.<br/><br/><br/><strong>catcher</strong><strong>: </strong>The catcher is the most physically demanding position in baseball, more so than the pitcher.<br/>Catcher is a position for a baseball or softball player.<br/>The catcher must avoid hitting the batter-runner with the thrown ball, implying that they must move to a position in which they have a clear throw to the infielder at first base.<br/>History and evolution of the position.<br/>Since a catcher uses their fingers to signal and communicate with the pitcher, they may wear colorful stickers on their nails to accentuate the motion of the fingers and thus help with the visibility of the signal.<br/>The catcher is the only player on the field who is allowed to use this type of mitt.<br/>Consequently, players who are left-handed rarely play catcher.<br/>If at the time a pitch is about to be thrown in play, and the catcher has overextended the arm resulting in the catcher's glove being over the homeplate, a catcher's interference' is called and the batter walks to first base.<br/>Together, the rules changes and the new protective equipment transformed the catcher's defensive role to the way that it is presently played.<br/>Since this type of pitching often caused the batter to hit lazy, foul pop-ups, catchers played their position approximately twenty to twenty-five feet behind the batter, and wore no protective equipment.<br/><br/><br/><strong>shortstop</strong><strong>: </strong>Adams's shortstop position, which he started playing at some time from 1849 to 1850, was used to field throws from the outfielders and throw to the three infielders.<br/>One theory of how the shortstop position got its name.<br/>Ernie Banks played shortstop for the first half of his career and first base for the remainder.<br/>The shortstop ordinarily is positioned near second base on the third-base side.<br/>In the numbering system used by scorers to record defensive plays, the shortstop is assigned the number 6.<br/>Shortstop, abbreviated SS, is the baseball or softball fielding position between second and third base, which is considered to be among the most demanding defensive positions.<br/>In practice, a marginal fielder as a shortstop who hits well can be moved to almost any other position, especially second base or third base, whether early in their careers (examples: George Brett and Mike Schmidt were both tried early in their careers as shortstops) or later due to diminished fielding range, slower reflexes, weaker throwing arms, increased risk of injury, or co-existence with another dominant shortstop, as with Ernie Banks, Cal Ripken Jr.<br/>Shortstops are required to cover second base in double play situations when the ball is hit to the second baseman or first baseman.<br/>They also cover second when a runner is attempting a stolen base, but only when a left-handed hitter is batting because the infield will respond to a left-handed batter by shifting toward first base, resulting in the shortstop being the infielder who is closest to second base.<br/>Historically the position was assigned to defensive specialists who were typically poor at batting and were often placed at the bottom of the batting order.<br/><br/><br/><strong>sports</strong><strong>: </strong>Among other sports that originated in ancient Persia are polo and jousting.<br/>The

throwing players have ever played second base in Major League Baseball since 1950.<br/>In baseball and softball, second baseman, abbreviated 2B, is a fielding position in the infield, between second

utilize rope to generate mechanical advantage.<br/>The ancient Egyptians were probably the first civilization to develop special tools to make rope.<br/>An additional drawback of twisted construction is that every fibre is exposed to abrasion numerous times along the length of the rope.<br/>The long history of rope means that many systems have been used to state the size of a rope.<br/>The current

may be encouraged to use the underhand serve on 36 feet (11 m) courts.<br/>The term kick serve is ambiguous.<br/>However, kick serve is commonly used to refer to any serve with heavy topspin or kick on it.<br/>In professional and amateur tennis, the reverse slice serve is rarely used except as a novelty.<br/>In the game of tennis, there are four commonly used serves: the \"flat serve\", the \"slice serve\", the \"kick serve\", and the \"underhand serve\".<br/>A serve (or, more formally, a service) in tennis is a shot to start a point.<br/>The underhand serve is struck below shoulder level.<br/>There are two popular stances in the tennis serve: the platform stance and the pinpoint stance.<br/>For a very long time, the use of an open stance to serve had been regarded as a sign of tennis beginner.<br/>The twist serve is a more extreme version of the kick serve, which involves more brushing of the ball from the 7\u20138 o'clock position to the 1\u20132 o'clock position, and

or Hawaiian grip is a very extreme tennis grip where the player places their knuckle past the 5th bevel on the tennis racket.<br/>There are four main grips for executing the forehand and their popularity has fluctuated over the years.<br/>For a right-handed player, the forehand is a stroke that begins on the right side of the body, continues across the body as contact is made with the ball, and ends on the left side of the body.<br/>The classical forehand where a player hit through the ball and finished their follow-through above the shoulder was the dominant forehand usage for most of tennis history.<br/>Most pro players now use the windshield wiper forehand, with Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic among other pro tennis players all employing the windshield wiper forehand.<br/>In his 1979 autobiography Jack Kramer, who had a great forehand himself, devotes a page to the best tennis strokes he had ever seen.<br/>Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro is an excellent

choked-up grip is Zina Garrison.<br/>Rackets that are moderately higher in power production, moderately lower in weight, moderately larger in size, and which typically possess a slightly head-heavy balance are often called \"tweener rackets.<br/>This predecessor to the modern game of squash, rackets, is played with 30 1\u20442-inch (770 mm) wooden rackets.<br/>An extremely typical mistake beginning players make is to choke up heavily on the racket (to try to compensate for twist from a light racket, as well as too high racket angle upon impact) and use the wrist too much.<br/>In real tennis, also called court tennis, 27-inch (686-mm) long rackets are made of wood and very tight strings to cope with the game's heavy balls.<br/>The vastly higher injury rate in tennis (when compared with the wood era) is, in part, due to the increase in stiffness, both of the racket and of the strings.<br/><br/><br/><strong>backhand</strong><strong>: </strong>Except in the phrase backhand volley, the term refers to a groundstroke (that is, one in which the ball has bounced before it is struck).<br/>The backhand is a tennis shot in which one swings the racquet around one's body with the back of the hand preceding the palm.<br/>Many tennis greats use the one-handed backhand.<br/>The advantages of the flat single-handed backhand include its speed, the angles it can produce and its depth.<br/>The advantages of the top-spin single-handed backhand include consistency, placement, the angles it can produce as well as its ability to cope with high balls.<br/>Despite there being many different variations and styles, in general there are three different techniques to hit the one-handed backhand.<br/>However, the two-handed backhand provides more stability and power for the shot, and is increasingly used in the modern game.<br/>The first notable players to use a two-handed backhand were the 1930s Australians Vivian McGrath and John Bromwich.<br/>From the 1940s to the 1960s, the flat single-handed backhand was popularised by many players, most famously Rod Laver and Don Budge.<br/>The first is the slice, the oldest version of the single-handed backhand, which was popularised by many classic players such as Ken Rosewall and was still used up until the 1980s even in the women's tour, with many great women champions such as Steffi Graf having one of the lowest, most effective slice backhands.<br/><br/><br/><strong>sports</strong><strong>: </strong>The precise definition of what separates a sport from other leisure activities varies between sources.<br/>Key principles of sport include that the result should not be predetermined, and that both sides should have equal opportunity to win.<br/>Amateur participation in sport at lower levels is often called \"grassroots sport\".<br/>The practice of athletic competitions has been criticised by some Christian thinkers as a form of idolatry, in which \"human beings extol themselves, adore themselves, sacrifice themselves and reward themselves.<br/>Among other sports that originated in ancient Persia are polo and jousting.<br/>Hawk-Eye is also used in tennis to challenge umpiring decisions.<br/>Sportsmanship is an attitude that strives for fair play, courtesy toward teammates and opponents, ethical behaviour and integrity, and grace in victory or defeat.<br/>Other meanings include gambling and events staged for the purpose of gambling.<br/>There are many shades of judging between boxing and mixed martial arts, where victory is assigned by judges if neither competitor has lost at the end of the match time.<br/>Other organisations, such as the Council of Europe, preclude activities without a physical element from classification as sports.<br/><br/><br/><strong>a low underhand tennis swing</strong><strong>: </strong>In children's tennis, young children may be encouraged to use the underhand serve on 36 feet (11 m) courts.<br/>The definition of a foot fault has changed several times since the introduction of (lawn) tennis.<br/>The term kick serve is ambiguous.<br/>However, kick serve is commonly used to refer to any serve with heavy topspin or kick on it.<br/>The term real is used as a retronym to distinguish the ancient game from the modern game of lawn tennis.<br/>Cannonball: Somewhat archaic term for a very fast, flat serve.<br/>In professional and amateur tennis, the reverse slice serve is rarely used except as a novelty.<br/>In the game of tennis, there are four commonly used serves: the \"flat serve\", the \"slice serve\", the \"kick serve\", and the \"underhand serve\".<br/>Dink: Onomatopoetic term for a shot with little pace, usually hit close to the net.<br/>Groundie: Colloquial word for a groundstroke.<br/><br/><br/><strong>crouch</strong><strong>: </strong>The fact that Crouch possessed \"good touch for a big man\" became something of a media clich\u00e9 during this time.<br/>In the summer of 2006, Crouch adopted a robotic dancing goal celebration.<br/>His second book, How to be a Footballer, was released in 2018.<br/>He was also known for his longevity, and had a penchant for scoring acrobatic goals from bicycle kicks.<br/>Contemporary reports suggested that Crouch was the first player ever to reach ten goals for England within a single calendar year.<br/>however, he was also known for his lack of significant pace, strength, power, and athleticism, while his movement occasionally came under criticism in the media.<br/>In the latter appearance, Crouch's introduction as a second-half substitute was booed by England's own supporters.<br/>A tall forward, with a slender physique, Crouch was known for possessing a good first touch, despite his stature, as well as an eye for goal.<br/>A parody of a dance he had been seen performing on a television programme covering a party held at England teammate David Beckham's house, he first performed it after his goal for England against Hungary on 30 May.<br/>He again performed the dance after both of his first two goals against Jamaica on 3 June.<br/><br/><br/><strong>soft tennis</strong><strong>: </strong>Most of the rules for soft tennis are the same as those for regular tennis.<br/>A special racquet and ball were developed, and the game became known as soft tennis (\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30c6\u30cb\u30b9, sofutotenisu).<br/>In 2004 soft tennis was introduced into Europe.<br/>Soft tennis is a racket game played on a court of two halves, separated by a net.<br/>The manager of the soft tennis

to better suit Japanese tastes.<br/><br/><br/><strong>tennis</strong><strong>: </strong>A difficult shot in tennis is the return of an attempted lob over the backhand side of a player.<br/>There are various grips for executing the forehand, and their popularity has fluctuated over the years.<br/>For right-handed players, the backhand is a stroke that begins on the left side of their body, continues across their body as contact is made with the ball, and ends on the right side of their body.<br/>Experienced players strive to master the conventional overhand serve to maximize its power and placement.<br/>For a right-handed player, the forehand is a stroke that begins on the right side of the body, continues across the body as contact is made with the ball, and ends on the left side of the body.<br/>the term \"hard court\" was used for clay courts at the time.<br/>Another, however informal, tennis format is called Canadian doubles.<br/>It is commonly used in modern tennis especially by \u2018top professional players on the forehand\u2019.<br/>This is the most common stance in tennis.<br/>This is sometimes also referred to as the square stance.<br/><br/><br/><strong>overhand</strong><strong>: </strong>There are a number of ways to tie the Overhand knot.<br/>In heraldry, the overhand knot is known as a \"Stafford knot\", owing to a representation of it being used first as a heraldic badge by the Earls of Stafford, and later as a general symbol of Staffordshire.<br/>The overhand knot is a stopper, especially when used alone, and hence it is very secure, to the point of jamming badly.<br/>If the two loose ends of an overhand knot are joined together (without creating additional crossings), this becomes equivalent to the trefoil knot of mathematical knot theory.<br/>An overhand knot becomes a trefoil knot, a true knot in the mathematical sense, by joining the ends.<br/>The overhand knot, also known as a a knot and half knot, is one of the most fundamental knots, and it forms the basis of many others, including the simple noose, overhand loop, angler's loop, reef knot, fisherman's knot, and water knot.<br/>If a flat ribbon or strip is tightly folded into a flattened overhand knot, it assumes a regular pentagonal shape.<br/>Trefoil knot, the mathematical treatment of the overhand knot.<br/>Overhand (boxing),

use neem twigs for brushing every morning.<br/>Special appliances or tools may be used to supplement toothbrushing and interdental cleaning.<br/>When compared to toothbrushes, teeth-cleaning twigs have several advantages:.<br/>Although many trees are used in the production of teeth-cleaning twigs, some trees are better suited to clean and protect the teeth, due to the chemical composition of the plant parts.<br/>Those with dentures and natural teeth may supplement their cleaning with a denture cleaner.<br/>This end can be used to brush against the teeth, while the other end can be used as a toothpick.<br/>This involves the use of various instruments or devices to loosen and remove deposits from the teeth.<br/>Ensure that the back sides of the teeth (top and bottom rows) are being cleaned by brushing vertically in up and down motions.<br/>People routinely clean their own teeth by brushing and interdental cleaning, and dental hygienists can remove hardened deposits (tartar) not removed by routine cleaning.<br/>Lower cost (0\u201316% of the cost of a toothbrush).<br/><br/><br/><strong>man</strong><strong>: </strong>Although in general men suffer from many of the same

example, greater masculinity usually brings greater social status.<br/>The Parsons model was used to contrast and illustrate extreme positions on gender roles.<br/>Like most other male mammals, a man's genome usually inherits an X chromosome from the mother and a Y chromosome from the father.<br/>For example, men tend to be taller than women, but there are many people of both sexes who are in the mid-height range for the species.<br/>Anthropology has shown that masculinity itself has social status, just like wealth, race and social class.<br/>Like most other male mammals, a man's genome typically inherits an X chromosome from his mother and a Y chromosome from his father.<br/>This difference in the relative amounts of these sex steroids is largely responsible for the physiological differences that distinguish men from women.<br/>In all cultures in the past, and still among traditional and non-Western cultures, getting married is the most common and definitive distinction

that naturally resist rot, such as teak, or by applying a protective coating to conventional wood or plastic.<br/>In the beginning stages of pottery, the coiling method of building was the most utilized technique to make pottery.<br/>Some vases are also given handles.<br/>The top register is a full scene, rather than a continuous pattern.<br/>Some vases have a shoulder, where the body curves

Charles H.<br/>The microwave absorption is directed by the dielectric constant of the tissue.<br/>At microwave frequencies, the transmission lines which are used to carry lower frequency radio waves to and from antennas, such as coaxial cable and parallel wire lines, have excessive power losses, so when low attenuation is required microwaves are carried by metal pipes called waveguides.<br/>Like a microwave, this lightbulb can burn, particularly if touched, but the burn is only possible due to too much heat.<br/>The epidermis has high electrical resistance for lower frequencies.<br/>Microwave energy can be focused by metal objects in the vicinity of the body or when implanted.<br/>his directional 450 MHz transmitter consisted of a 26 cm brass rod dipole antenna with a spark gap between the ends, suspended at the focal line of a parabolic antenna made of a curved zinc sheet, powered by high voltage pulses from an induction coil.<br/>Household microwave ovens have shielding around the inside of the oven that prevents microwaves from leaking out, as well as safety interlocks that prevent the oven from operating when the door is open.<br/>The instruments used are designed to focus most of the power to the animal's head.<br/>The main effect of absorption of microwaves is to heat materials.<br/><br/><br/><strong>copyright</strong><strong>: </strong>This included paintings, the argument being that the frame was detachable.<br/>The sound recording copyright symbol is the symbol \u2117 (the capital letter P enclosed by a circle), and is used to designate copyright in a sound

works.<br/><br/><br/><strong>paper</strong><strong>: </strong>Also, synthetics such as Tyvek and Teslin have been introduced as printing media as a more durable material than paper.<br/>Alum was added to paper to assist in sizing, making it somewhat water resistant so that inks did not \"run\" or spread uncontrollably.<br/>Paper made from wood pulp is not necessarily less durable than a rag paper.<br/>Made out of paper, and known commercially as PaperFoam, the new packaging has mechanical properties very similar to those of some expanded plastic packaging, but is biodegradable and can also be recycled with ordinary paper.<br/>When making paper by hand, a blotter sheet is used instead.<br/>Book publishers tend to use acid-free paper, made from fully bleached chemical pulps for hardback and trade paperback books.<br/>Coated paper has a thin layer of material such as calcium carbonate or china clay applied to one or both sides in order to create a surface more suitable for high-resolution halftone screens.<br/>for temporary personal use: scratch paper.<br/>These locations are designed to look as if they are made out of paper, and contain coins and other various

bamboo.<br/><br/><br/><strong>pyrex</strong><strong>: </strong>European Pyrex is still made from borosilicate.<br/>Older clear-glass Pyrex manufactured by Corning, Arc International's Pyrex products, and Pyrex laboratory glassware are made of borosilicate glass.<br/>Jesse Littleton of Corning discovered the cooking potential of borosilicate glass by giving his wife Bessie Littleton a casserole dish made from a cut-down Nonex battery jar.<br/>Their investigation confirmed the borosilicate glass would withstand a much larger rapid temperature change.<br/>However, its thermal shock resistance is lower than borosilicate's, leading to potential breakage from heat stress if used contrary to recommendations.<br/>The mirror was cast by Corning during 1934\u20131936 out of borosilicate glass.<br/>A previous effort to fabricate the optic from fused quartz had failed, with the cast blank having voids.<br/>It was later expanded to include clear and opal ware products made of soda-lime glass.<br/>According to glass supplier Pulles and Hannique, borosilicate Pyrex is made of Corning 7740 glass and is equivalent in formulation to Schott Glass 8330 glass sold under the \"Duran\" brand

as barium titanate (BaTiO3).<br/>A lacquer or ceramic coating protects the capacitor against moisture and other ambient influences.<br/>A ceramic is any of the various hard, brittle, heat-resistant and corrosion-resistant materials made by shaping and then firing a nonmetallic mineral, such as clay, at a high temperature.<br/>A thin ceramic foil is cast from a suspension of the powder with a suitable binder.<br/>The easy-to-mold ceramic material facilitated the development of special and large styles of ceramic capacitors for high-voltage, high-frequency (RF) and power applications.<br/>Class 1 ceramic capacitors are accurate, temperature-compensating capacitors.<br/>The earliest ceramics made by humans were pottery objects (pots or vessels) or figurines made from clay, either by itself or mixed with other materials like silica, hardened and sintered in fire.<br/>For ferroelectric class 2 ceramic capacitors, the soldering temperature is above the Curie point.<br/>It is constructed of two or more alternating layers of ceramic and a metal layer acting as the electrodes.<br/><br/><br/><strong>cup</strong><strong>: </strong>Prehistoric cups were sometimes fashioned from shells and hollowed out stones.<br/>therefore, while a cup made of paper is a \"paper cup\", a transparent one for drinking shots is called a \"shot glass\", instead.<br/>While in theory, most cups are well suited to hold drinkable liquids, hot drinks like tea are generally served in either insulated cups or porcelain teacups.<br/>The measuring cup, an adaptation of a simple cup, is a standard tool in cooking that has been in use at least as far back as Roman times.<br/>Many trophies take the form of a large, decorated cup.<br/>Disposable cups.<br/>Cups may be made of glass, metal, china, clay, wood, stone, polystyrene, plastic, aluminium or other materials, and are usually fixed with a stem, handles, or other adornments.<br/>Various cups have been designed so that drinking out of them without spilling is a challenge.<br/>A \"divining cup\" was supposed to be able to detect poison.<br/>Disposable cups are intended to be used only once.<br/><br/><br/><strong>metal</strong><strong>: </strong>The thermal conductivity of metals is useful for containers to heat materials over a flame.<br/>and neutron irradiation resistant parts for nuclear applications.<br/>Electrical power grids rely on metal cables to distribute electricity.<br/>Home electrical systems, for the most part, are wired with copper wire for its good conducting properties.<br/>The Gilchrist-Thomas process (or basic Bessemer process) was an improvement to the Bessemer process, made by lining the converter with a basic material to remove phosphorus.<br/>Metals are also used for heat sinks to protect sensitive equipment from overheating.<br/>Initially, bronze was made of copper and arsenic (forming arsenic bronze) by smelting naturally or artificially mixed ores of copper and arsenic.<br/>The metal drum setup is generally much larger than those employed in other forms of rock music.<br/>With one exception, metallic elements reduce their electrical conductivity when heated.<br/>Currently the most important applications rely on the special magnetic properties of some ferromagnetic metallic glasses.<br/><br/><br/><strong>clay</strong><strong>: </strong>These plates are tough but flexible, and in moist clay, they adhere to each other.<br/>In kaolinite clay, the bonding between plates is provided by a film of water molecules that hydrogen bond the plates together.<br/>High-quality clay is also tough, as measured by the amount of mechanical work required to roll a sample of clay flat.<br/>Cooking pots, art objects, dishware, smoking pipes, and even musical instruments such as the ocarina can all be shaped from clay before being fired.<br/>When the clay is fired to the earthenware stage, a dehydration reaction removes additional water from the clay, causing clay plates to irreversibly adhere to each other via stronger covalent bonding, which strengthens the material.<br/>Between one-half and two-thirds of the world's population still live or work in buildings made with clay, often baked into brick, as an essential part of its load-bearing structure.<br/>Between one-half and two-thirds of the world's population, in both traditional societies as well as developed countries, still live or work in buildings made with clay, often baked into brick, as an essential part of its load-bearing structure.<br/>However, most clay deposits are impure.<br/>If the clay is moistened again, it will once more become plastic.<br/>The defining mechanical property of clay is its plasticity when wet and its ability to harden when dried or fired.<br/><br/><br/><strong>the measuring cup</strong><strong>: </strong>Measuring cups may be made of plastic, glass, or metal.<br/>Liquid measure cups tend to be microwave safe for heating and clear to more easily judge the meniscus.<br/>Many European measuring cups have markings that indicate the weight of common ingredients for a given volume.<br/>WBUR story on a measuring cup design

rubber.<br/>The cups are supported by a wire that encircles the tree.<br/>Once the rubber is vulcanized, it is a thermoset.<br/>The ball is usually made from 100% rubber bands, but some instructions call for using a marble or a ping-pong ball as a starting point.<br/>In stretched rubber, the chains are almost linear.<br/>The latex is led into the cup by a galvanised \"spout\" knocked into the bark.<br/>In animal husbandry, rubber bands are used for docking and castration of livestock.<br/>Most rubber bands are manufactured out of natural rubber or, especially at larger sizes, elastomer, and are sold in a variety of sizes.<br/>Because of their electrical resistance, soft rubber goods are used as insulation and for protective gloves, shoes and blankets.<br/>The biomembrane is held tightly to the rubber core due to the high negative charge along the double bonds of the rubber polymer backbone.<br/><br/><br/><strong>microwave,microwave oven</strong><strong>: </strong>In a similar

contract with Vivid were It's Sunny in Brazil, which was filmed in Brazil, and The Sunny Experiment also starring Monique Alexander and Brea Lynn.<br/>\" Another review in Bollywood Hungama goes on to note if there was any real contribution from Sunny herself towards the book other than her picture on the cover.<br/>\" Sunny Leone add that it is \"the first time (she has) written something like

adopt a child.<br/>\"Sunny Leone in an interview to Press Trust of India explains that the book is written from the perspective of both men and females, as well as being written for both genders but mainly for women.<br/>One critic said \"Leone may not be better than this film, but she's the best thing in it.<br/>\"Sunny\", a song by Stereophonics on their 2015 album Keep the Village Alive.<br/>The characters are not complicated or unpleasant and exist in a world that veers on the border of Valentine's Land with its floating pink hearts and soft focus lighting.<br/>Well, the fact is, God has always been with them the entire time.<br/><br/><br/><strong>overcast</strong><strong>: </strong>Sometimes clouds can be different colors such as black or white, but overcast usually refers to darker skies.<br/>Periods of overcast weather can range from a few hours to several days.<br/>In some cases, it can be impossible to see distinct borders of clouds or the sky may be covered by a single type of cloud, such as stratus and the whole sky will be a dull white.<br/>An overcast sky may be explicitly identified as thin (mostly transparent), but otherwise is considered opaque, which always constitutes a ceiling in aviation meteorology.<br/>However, the total cloud cover must not be entirely due to obscuring phenomena near the surface, such as fog.<br/>The same weather, when observed from above, might be referred to as (an) undercast.<br/>Overcast, written as \"OVC\" in the METAR observation, is reported when the cloud cover is observed to equal eight oktas (eighths).<br/>Overcast or overcast weather, as defined by the World Meteorological Organization, is the meteorological condition of clouds obscuring at least 95% of the sky.<br/>Overcast weather can also affect people suffering from seasonal affective disorder.<br/>Forward scatter.<br/><br/><br/><strong>rain</strong><strong>: </strong>What are clouds, and why does it rain?.<br/>In temperate climates, people tend to be more stressed when the weather is unstable or cloudy, with its impact greater on men than women.<br/>If one wants an accumulated rainfall over a time period, one has to add up all the accumulations from each grid box within the images during that time.<br/>leeward sides are drier and sunnier, with less rain and less cloud cover.<br/>A common biome in this area is the tundra which has a short summer thaw and a long frozen winter.<br/>The forecasts can be verified through use of rain gauge measurements, weather radar estimates, or a combination of both.<br/>BBC article on the mathematics of running in the rain.<br/>In addition, because of the great temperature difference between cloud and ground level, these ice crystals may melt as they fall and become rain.<br/>In certain conditions precipitation may fall from a cloud but then evaporate or sublime before reaching the ground.<br/>In areas with wet and dry seasons, soil nutrients diminish and erosion increases during the wet season.<br/><br/><br/><strong>bear</strong><strong>: </strong>When a black bear sees a grizzly coming, it either turns tail and runs or climbs a tree.<br/>Many Native American tribes both respect and fear the brown bear.<br/>For example, many Pacific coastal islands off British Columbia and Alaska support either the black bear or the grizzly, but rarely both.<br/>Sun bears use their long tongues to lick up both insects and honey.<br/>When a grizzly descends on a cougar feeding on its kill, the cougar usually gives way to the bear.<br/>Berries may be foraged in bushes or at the tops of trees, and bears try to maximize the number of berries consumed versus foliage.<br/>a black bear's rump is higher than its shoulders.<br/>20 to 30 grizzlies can be observed at the creek at one time and like Brooks Camp, visitors can watch bears from an above platform.<br/>Mothers may see their cubs in later years but both avoid each other.<br/>When this happens, it is usually with the grizzly being the aggressor.<br/><br/><br/><strong>blanket</strong><strong>: </strong>Their design reduces the heat loss in a person's body, which would otherwise occur due to thermal radiation, water evaporation, or convection.<br/>Wearing a space blanket produced an insignificantly slower cooling rate after running in hot, humid conditions.<br/>Are Space Blankets Worth Having?.<br/>Many children and adults use a blanket as a comfort object.<br/>Space blankets are often given to marathoners and other endurance athletes at the end of races, or while waiting before races if the weather is chilly.<br/>Lost campers and hikers have an additional possible benefit: the shiny surface flashes in the sun, allowing its use as an improvised distress beacon for searchers and as a method of signalling over long distances to other people.<br/>Small children (and some adults) may also use a blanket as a comfort object.<br/>Their low weight and compact size before unfurling make them ideal when space or weight are at a premium.<br/>Blankets may be spread on the ground for a picnic or where people want to sit in a grassy or muddy area without soiling their clothing.<br/>It traps radiant bodily heat that otherwise would be lost through convection, helping to keep the user warm.<br/><br/><br/><strong>dark</strong><strong>: </strong>when all three components are unilluminated (0,0,0), the pixel appears black.<br/>An object may appear dark, but it may be bright at a frequency that humans cannot perceive.<br/>Such shapes draw the eye around areas of the painting.<br/>When the red, green, and blue components of a pixel are fully illuminated (255,255,255), the pixel appears white.<br/>A dark area has limited light sources, making things hard to see.<br/>Human vision is unable to distinguish color in conditions of either high brightness or very low brightness.<br/>Artists use darkness to emphasize and contrast the presence of light.<br/>The word dark eventually evolved from the word deorc.<br/>The perception of darkness differs from the mere absence of light due to the effects of after images on perception.<br/>Exposure to alternating light and darkness (night and day) has caused several evolutionary adaptations to darkness.<br/><br/><br/>", "concept": "<strong>rain</strong><strong>: </strong>liquid sunshine is related to rain<br/>washing your car causes it to

Tibetan plateau goats are kept for down production.<br/>They are raised for cashmere production and used as pack animals.<br/>Most common goat breeds, including dairy goats, grow this two-coated fleece.<br/>The developers of the breed claim the lustre of the fleece is better than the Liaoning goat.<br/>About 60% of the goats are white.<br/>This dual-purpose goat is found in the L\u00fcliang area.<br/>The goats can be divided into five strains, Alasan (Alashanzuoqi), Arbus, Erlangshan, Hanshan and Wuzhumuqin.<br/>The foundation stock for the Australian Cashmere Goat was taken from northern and western Australia from the local bush goat population in the late 1970s.<br/>In the past decades, breeding programs have been started to develop productive breeds.<br/>The herd has been continually developed since then, and used to improve the cashmere herd throughout China.<br/><br/><br/><strong>wool</strong><strong>: </strong>This semigrease wool can be worked into yarn and knitted into particularly water-resistant mittens or sweaters, such as those of the Aran Island fishermen.<br/>As an animal protein, wool can be used as a soil fertilizer, being a slow-release source of nitrogen.<br/>Damage or breaks in the wool can occur if the sheep is stressed while it is growing its fleece, resulting in a thin spot where the fleece is likely to break.<br/>Lanolin removed from wool is widely used in cosmetic products, such as hand creams.<br/>On sheep, the hair part of the fleece is called kemp.<br/>Australia is a leading producer of wool which is mostly from Merino sheep but has been eclipsed by China in terms of total weight.<br/>Breeds such as Lincoln, Romney, Drysdale, and Elliotdale produce coarser fibers, and wool from these sheep is usually used for making carpets.<br/>Such yarns are typically used as weft yarns with a cotton warp.<br/>The quality of fleeces is determined by a technique known as wool classing, whereby a qualified person, called a wool classer, groups wools of similar grading together to maximize the return for the farmer or sheep owner.<br/>The sheepwalks of Castile  were controlled by the Mesta union of sheep owners.<br/><br/><br/><strong>sweater</strong><strong>: </strong>Sports sweaters are often worn on tops of sports kit while traveling to or from a sports ground.<br/>Some women's sweaters are meant to be worn belted.<br/>Even when such shaping is used, it can be knit into the fabric itself, without requiring seams.<br/>Sweaters are often maintained by washing or dry cleaning and the use of a lint roller or pill razor.<br/>Thin sweaters may be worn tucked into the waistband of trousers.<br/>a belt or drawstring is sometimes knitted into the sweater itself.<br/>Sweaters can be worn with a dress shirt underneath (and optionally a tie), which has the advantage of allowing the wearer to have the option of removing the sweater when it is uncomfortably warm and still looking presentable in many situations.<br/>Leggings are commonly worn with long sweaters or sweater dresses.<br/>The use of detergent is in fact detrimental because it removes the lanolin, which helps the wool to repel and shed dirt as well as water.<br/>Sweaters were traditionally made from wool but can now be made of cotton, synthetic fibers, or any combination of these.<br/><br/><br/><strong>terrestrial animal</strong><strong>: </strong>They are adapted to most of the habitats on Earth.<br/>Saxicolous creatures are rock dwelling.<br/>Many animals considered terrestrial have a life-cycle that is partly dependent on being in water.<br/>Most terrestrialization events have occurred during the Paleozoic or Mesozoic.<br/>Some members of rissooidean families Truncatellidae, Assimineidae, and Pomatiopsidae are considered to have colonized to land during the Cenozoic.<br/>Evolution and adaptation of terrestrial arthropods.<br/>Nematodes are usually microscopic with this lifestyle.<br/>Terrestrial reconnaissance, a type of reconnaissance that is employed along the elements of ground warfare.<br/>In terrestrial habitats they are subjected to daily and seasonal variation in temperature and water availability.<br/>Many microscopic crustacean groups like copepods and amphipods (of which Sandhoppers are members) and Seed Shrimp are known to go dormant when dry and live in transient bodies of water too.<br/><br/><br/><strong>fleece</strong><strong>: </strong>Alternatively, the fleeces would be used on washing tables in alluvial mining of gold or on washing tables at deep gold mines.<br/>The fleece is a symbol of authority and kingship.<br/>The golden fleece was defended by bulls with hoofs of brass and breath of fire.<br/>Fleeces, woollen coats of a domestic sheep or long-haired goat, especially after being shorn.<br/>The fleeces would be hung in trees to dry before the gold was shaken or combed out.<br/>It represents a breed of sheep in ancient Georgia.<br/>Horticultural fleece, a polypropylene fabric used to protect plants.<br/>The dragon was at the foot of the tree on which the fleece was placed.<br/>It represents the riches imported from the East.<br/>The following are the chief among the various interpretations of the fleece, with notes on sources and major critical discussions:.<br/><br/><br/><strong>fur</strong><strong>: </strong>The hair of sheep is commonly referred to as wool, rather than fur.<br/>The use of fur as clothing or decoration is controversial.<br/>The fur of mammals has many uses: protection, sensory purposes, waterproofing, and camouflaging, with the primary usage being thermoregulation.<br/>Fur is also used to make felt.<br/>Today fur and trim used in garments may be dyed bright colors or to mimic exotic animal patterns, or shorn close like velvet.<br/>Two ships were sent out in 1668.<br/>The fur farming industry is present in many parts of Canada.<br/>The awn hair can be thought of as a hybrid, bridging the gap between the distinctly different characteristics of down and guard hairs.<br/>Pelts were worn in or out, depending on their characteristics and desired use.<br/>The denseness of fur can increase an animal's insulation value, and arctic mammals especially have dense fur.<br/><br/><br/><strong>goat</strong><strong>: </strong>Milk from goats is often turned into goat cheese.<br/>Its horns can be used instead of sheep's horn to make a shofar.<br/>Goats have been used for milk, meat, fur, and skins across much of the world.<br/>Excess male kids of dairy breeds are typically slaughtered for meat.<br/>Some goats are bred specifically for milk.<br/>The intestine of goats is used to make \"catgut\", which is still in use as a material for internal human surgical sutures and strings for musical instruments.<br/>The miniature dairy goats may be judged by either of the two scorecards.<br/>These methods of herding are still used today.<br/>The horn of the goat, which signifies plenty and wellbeing (the cornucopia), is also used to make spoons.<br/>In various places in China, goats are used in the production of tea.<br/><br/><br/><strong>sheep</strong><strong>: </strong>roughly six sheep can be kept on the amount that would suffice for a single cow or horse.<br/>Long wool sheep are most valued for crossbreeding to improve the attributes of other sheep types.<br/>Sheep have been used as pack animals.<br/>Fleeces are used as material in making alternative products such as wool insulation.<br/>A sheep's wool is the most widely used animal fiber, and is usually harvested by shearing.<br/>\" Almost all sheep are classified as being best suited to furnishing a certain product: wool, meat, milk, hides, or a combination in a dual-purpose breed.<br/>Dual-purpose breeds that may primarily be meat or wool sheep are often used secondarily as milking animals, but there are a few breeds that are predominantly used for milking.<br/>much sheep behavior can be understood on the basis of these tendencies.<br/>As the demand for carpet-quality wool declines, some breeders of this type of sheep are attempting to use a few of these traditional breeds for alternative purposes.<br/>Domestic sheep provide a wide array of raw materials.<br/><br/><br/><strong>sheer</strong><strong>: </strong>Sheering village is situated 2.<br/>Sheers, a form of two-legged lifting device.<br/>Sheer curation, a lightweight approach to digital curation.<br/>The Stort Navigation to the west has a lock at Sheering

Hertfordshire and its railway station, forms part of the civil parish.<br/>Harry Goschen, baronet of Durrington House in the Parish of Sheering and County of Essex.<br/>Sheering village has approximately 350 households.<br/><br/><br/><strong>white box</strong><strong>: </strong>White-box testing can be applied at the unit, integration and system levels of the software testing process.<br/>Side effects of having the knowledge of the source code is beneficial to thorough testing.<br/>White-box testing is one of the two biggest testing methods used today.<br/>The code under test could be rewritten to implement the same functionality in a different way that invalidates the assumptions baked into the test.<br/>Optimization of code becomes easy as inconspicuous bottlenecks are exposed.<br/>Easy to automate.<br/>Once the source code is understood then the source code can be analyzed for test cases to be created.<br/>The resulting test can be fragile because they are tightly coupled to the specific implementation of the thing being tested.<br/>It can test paths within a unit, paths between units during integration, and between subsystems during a system\u2013level test.<br/>These test cases are derived through the use of the design techniques mentioned above: control flow testing, data flow testing, branch testing, path testing, statement coverage and decision coverage as well as modified condition/decision coverage.<br/><br/><br/><strong>shear</strong><strong>: </strong>Also constructions in soil can fail due to shear.<br/>This relationship can be exploited to measure the wall shear stress.<br/>Semi-monocoque shear.<br/>Sheep shearing.<br/>The removal of nap during wool cloth production.<br/>The measured value of wall velocity gradient is

portion of American houses use wood, while most British and many European houses use stone, brick, or mud.<br/>Lesser-used construction methods have gained (or regained) popularity in recent years.<br/>In the United States, modern house construction techniques include light-frame construction (in areas with access to supplies of wood) and adobe or sometimes rammed-earth construction (in arid regions with scarce wood-resources).<br/>Increasingly popular alternative construction materials include insulating concrete forms (foam forms filled with concrete), structural insulated panels (foam panels faced with oriented strand board or fiber cement), light-gauge steel, and steel framing.<br/>In many parts of the world, houses are constructed using scavenged materials.<br/>In Manila's Payatas neighborhood, slum houses are often made of material sourced from a nearby garbage dump.<br/>Houses use a range of different roofing systems to keep precipitation such as rain from getting

bodies as opposed to animals that digest their food inside their bodies.<br/>Young babies eat pureed baby foods because they have few teeth and immature digestive systems.<br/>Animals and other heterotrophs must eat in order to survive \u2014 carnivores eat other animals, herbivores eat plants, omnivores consume a mixture of both plant and animal matter, and detritivores eat detritus.<br/>Newborn babies do not eat adult foods.<br/>The environmental signals come from the body's senses.<br/>For humans, eating is an activity of daily living.<br/>Some individuals may limit their amount of nutritional intake.<br/>They survive solely on breast milk or formula.<br/>Conversely, snacks are usually eaten alone.<br/><br/><br/><strong>leaf</strong><strong>: </strong>Other herbivores and their predators mimic the appearance of the leaf.<br/>Accordingly, leaves are prominent in the diet of many animals.<br/>Animals that are specialized to eat leaves are known as folivores.<br/>Some species have cryptic adaptations by which they use leaves in avoiding predators.<br/>Some sawflies similarly roll the leaves of their food plants into tubes.<br/>Some structures of non-vascular plants look and function much like leaves.<br/>Not every species produces leaves with all of these structural components.<br/>In many aquatic species, the leaves are submerged in water.<br/>Many gymnosperms have thin needle-like or scale-like leaves that can be advantageous in cold climates with frequent snow and frost.<br/>Green plants are autotrophic, meaning that they do not obtain food from other living things but instead create their own food by photosynthesis.<br/><br/><br/><strong>these animals</strong><strong>: </strong>Most animals rely on the biomass and energy produced by plants through photosynthesis.<br/>Other animals may have very specific feeding behaviours, such as hawksbill sea turtles primarily eating sponges.<br/>Several animals are microscopic.<br/>Some animals are capable of asexual reproduction, which often results in a genetic clone of the parent.<br/>Herbivores eat plant material directly, while carnivores, and other animals on higher trophic levels typically acquire it indirectly by eating other animals.<br/>Nearly all animals make use of some form of sexual reproduction.<br/>All animals are motile (able to spontaneously move their bodies) during at least part of their life cycle, but some animals, such as sponges, corals, mussels, and barnacles, later become sessile.<br/>Several animal phyla lack bilateral symmetry.<br/>All animals are composed of cells, surrounded by a characteristic extracellular matrix composed of collagen and elastic glycoproteins.<br/>With very few exceptions, animals respire aerobically.<br/><br/><br/><strong>head</strong><strong>: </strong>Other animals.<br/>Some very simple animals may not have a head, but many bilaterally symmetric forms do, regardless of size.<br/>Insects have mouth parts in various shapes depending on their feeding habits.<br/>In bilaterally symmetrical animals, nervous tissues concentrate at the anterior region, forming structures responsible for information processing.<br/>A typical insect head is composed of eyes, antennae, and components of mouth.<br/>Heads develop in animals by an evolutionary trend known as cephalization.<br/>Though invertebrate chordates \u2013 such as the tunicate larvae or the lancelets \u2013 have heads, there has been a question of how the vertebrate head, characterized by a bony skull clearly separated from the main body, might have evolved from the head structures of these animals.<br/>The heads of humans and other animals are commonly recurring charges in heraldry.<br/>Now all tennis balls are produced in China.<br/>According to Hyman (1979), the evolution of the head in the vertebrates has occurred by the fusion of a fixed number of anterior segments, in the same manner as in other \"heteronomously segmented animals\".<br/><br/><br/><strong>plant</strong><strong>: </strong>Many animals rely on plants for shelter as well as oxygen and food.<br/>Many animals pollinate flowers in exchange for food in the form of pollen or nectar.<br/>Numerous animals have coevolved with plants.<br/>Other organisms form mutually beneficial relationships with plants.<br/>Many animals disperse seeds, often by eating fruit and passing the seeds in their feces.<br/>Humans depend on plants for food, either directly or as feed for domestic animals.<br/>many tropical plants lose their leaves during the dry season.<br/>Some plants reproduce sexually, some asexually, and some via both means.<br/>Herbivores eat plants, but plants can defend themselves and some species are parasitic or even carnivorous.<br/>Some mosses grow less than 0.<br/><br/><br/><strong>grass</strong><strong>: </strong>Many types of animals eat grass as their main source of food, and are called graminivores \u2013 these include cattle, sheep, horses, rabbits and many invertebrates, such as grasshoppers and the caterpillars of many brown butterflies.<br/>Grasses are also eaten by omnivorous or even occasionally by primarily carnivorous animals.<br/>The evolution of large grazing animals in the Cenozoic contributed to the spread of grasses.<br/>The leaf blades of many grasses are hardened with silica phytoliths, which discourage grazing animals.<br/>Grass, plants growing in the ground.<br/>Many species of grass are grown as pasture for foraging or as fodder for prescribed livestock feeds, particularly in the case of cattle, horses, and sheep.<br/>hence, grasses can quickly recover from cropping at the top.<br/>Straw (and sometimes hay) may also be used as bedding for animals.<br/>The C4 grasses have a photosynthetic pathway, linked to specialized Kranz leaf anatomy, which allows for increased water use efficiency, rendering them better adapted to hot, arid environments.<br/>Trampling grazers kill seedling trees but not grasses.<br/><br/><br/><strong>peanut</strong><strong>: </strong>Most Indians use mustard, sunflower, and peanut oil for cooking.<br/>As animal food.<br/>Eating a small amount of peanut can cause a reaction.<br/>The domesticated plants are bushier and more compact, and have a different pod structure and larger seeds.<br/>Many pre-Columbian cultures, such as the Moche, depicted peanuts in their art.<br/>Meanwhile, the hearts of peanuts are segregated through inspection.<br/>Spanish peanuts have a higher oil content than other types of peanuts.<br/>Virginia group peanuts are either bunch or running in growth habit.<br/>Some peanuts can also be fed whole to livestock, for example those in excess of the peanut quota in the US, or those with a higher aflatoxin content than that permitted by the food regulations.<br/>The most important diseases are leaf spots, rusts and the toxin-producing fungus Aspergillus.<br/><br/><br/><strong>elephant</strong><strong>: </strong>African forest elephants ingest and defecate seeds, with either no effect or a positive effect on germination.<br/>These animals were relatively small and aquatic.<br/>The animal's field of vision is compromised by the location and limited mobility of the eyes.<br/>One elephant has been observed to graze by kneeling on its front legs, raising on its hind legs and taking in grass with its lips.<br/>These animals do not reproduce well in captivity, due to the difficulty of handling musth bulls and limited understanding of female oestrous cycles.<br/>An elephant uses mud as a sunscreen, protecting its skin from ultraviolet light.<br/>These animals are typically captured from the wild when they are 10\u201320 years old when they can be trained quickly and easily, and will have a longer working life.<br/>They browse more in the dry season with bark constituting a major part of their diet in the cool part of that season.<br/>Working animal.<br/>The animal's sense of smell may be four times as sensitive as that of a bloodhound.<br/><br/><br/><strong>hay</strong><strong>: </strong>Most animals are fed hay in two daily feedings, morning and evening.<br/>Some animals are sensitive to particular fungi or molds that may grow on living plants.<br/>Different animals also use hay in different ways: cattle evolved to eat forages in relatively large quantities at a single feeding, and then, due to the process of rumination, take a considerable amount of time for their stomachs to digest food, often accomplished while the animal is lying down, at rest.<br/>Both types of animals can digest cellulose in grass and hay, but do so by different mechanisms.<br/>Some animals, especially those being raised for meat, may be given enough hay that they simply are able to eat all day.<br/>Some animals are also fed concentrated feeds such as grain or vitamin supplements in addition to hay.<br/>Other animals, especially those that are ridden or driven as working animals, are only free to eat when not working, and may be given a more limited amount of hay to prevent them from getting too fat.<br/>Some plants themselves may also be toxic to some animals.<br/>They require three to four hours per day to eat enough hay to meet their nutritional requirements.<br/>Therefore, different types of animals require hay that consists of similar plants to what they would eat while grazing, and likewise, plants that are toxic to an animal in pasture are also toxic if they are dried into hay.<br/><br/><br/>", "concept": "<strong>peanut</strong><strong>: </strong>peanut milk is related to peanut<br/>mixed nuts are related to peanut<br/>peanut butter is related to peanut<br/>wenchang

maintained through JAL's passenger aircraft lower deck holds.<br/>Previously this aircraft carried the Shingo Katori and the Saiyuki television livery.<br/>It features a shell-shaped seat that allows passengers to recline by sliding their seat forward, without having the seat in front intrude when reclining.<br/>Various aircraft in the JAL fleet also carry a Yokoso Japan logo supporting the Visit Japan campaign, in various forms.<br/>Executive and First Class passengers have full AVOD control.<br/>The airline provides economy class service on all routes.<br/>These aircraft were typically used by JALways on charter flights to holiday destinations in the Pacific, such as Hawaii.<br/>Like SS6 aircraft, SS2 and SS9 II aircraft are operating on shorter international routes.<br/>There will be USB ports for iPod connectivity, and an easier to control handset.<br/><br/><br/><strong>travel</strong><strong>: </strong>many countries have penalties for violating seatbelt laws.<br/>however most countries accept international driving permits.<br/>Motives for travel include:.<br/>Many countries do not recognize drivers' licenses from other countries.<br/>Travellers may use human-powered transport such as walking or bicycling.<br/>to the 21st century where aircraft allow travel from Spain to the United States overnight.<br/>This link may reflect the extreme difficulty of travel in ancient times.<br/>or vehicles, such as public transport, automobiles, trains and airplanes.<br/>Wearing a seat belt is highly advisable for safety reasons.<br/>It is also advisable to become oriented with the driving rules and -regulations of destination countries.<br/><br/><br/><strong>land</strong><strong>: </strong>The height of the land is important in creating and transforming airflow and precipitation on Earth.<br/>The division between land and water is a fundamental concept to humans.<br/>but this proportion is decreased by the land's increased terrain.<br/>The latitude of the land will influence how much solar radiation reaches the surface.<br/>The land of the Earth interacts with and influences climate heavily since the surface of the land heats up and cools down faster than air or water.<br/>These inner planets have a rocky surface with metal interiors.<br/>Such systems had design flaws that would allow the device to accept request on the wire appearing to be from themselves, causing repeated replies.<br/>The atmosphere and oceans of the Earth continuously shape the land by eroding and transporting solids on the surface.<br/>Planetary bodies that have a thin atmosphere often have land that is marked by impact craters since atmospheric conditions would normally break-down incoming objects and erode rough impact sites.<br/>Most firewalls should intercept and discard the poison packet thus protecting the host from this attack.<br/><br/><br/><strong>metal fence</strong><strong>: </strong>The fence is not designed to concentrate or channel stormwater.<br/>The design/placement of the silt fence should create a pooling of runoff, which then allows sedimentation to occur.<br/>Pet fence, an underground fence for pet containment.<br/>characteristically two courses of waler are added on the interior side to reinforce the wall.<br/>Around mast radiators, wooden fences are used to avoid the problem of eddy currents.<br/>The metal backing gives the fence increased strength to resist the weight of soil and water which may be trapped by the fence in a large drainage area, and discourages construction site operators from driving vehicles over the fence.<br/>Conversely, for common land, it is the surrounding landowners' duty to fence the common's livestock out such as in large parts of the New Forest.<br/>Otherwise it tends to be on non-owner's side so the fence owner might access the posts when repairs are needed but this is not a legal requirement.<br/>Silt fences are often installed as perimeter controls.<br/>Sand and silt tends to clog the fabric, and then the sediments settle in the temporary pond.<br/><br/><br/><strong>the wheels</strong><strong>: </strong>Morrison was a member of the band, briefly, before they became known as the Wheels.<br/>The song is based on a vintage blues by Peter Chatman.<br/>The artwork for the album was by Martin Sharp who had also done the artwork for Disraeli Gears.<br/>Six shows were recorded in San Francisco by Pappalardi and recording engineer Bill Halverson, and extra performances not included on Wheels of Fire ended up on Live Cream and Live Cream Volume II.<br/>Felix Pappalardi \u2013 viola, bells, organ, trumpet, tonette.<br/>^Note 3:  Some songs on the studio album were processed with the Haeco-CSG system.<br/>The band's drummer Ginger Baker co-wrote three songs for the album with pianist Mike Taylor.<br/>Haeco-CSG was intended to make stereo recordings that were compatible with mono playback but has the unfortunate side effect of \"blurring\" the phantom centre channel.<br/>Tommy Scott, who had previously worked with Them, would produce their records for the label.<br/>In the UK the studio album art was black print on aluminium foil while the live album art was a negative image of the studio cover.<br/><br/><br/><strong>plane</strong><strong>: </strong>Planing (boat), where weight is predominantly supported by hydrodynamic lift.<br/>The aircraft was later rented or sold to parties who later used it to smuggle drugs into the United States, and it crashed in a swamp on at least one occasion.<br/>The animated film is itself a general parody of the television series.<br/>It was one of the few Widgeons converted with radial engines.<br/>Ze Plane!

of the plane.<br/>It was involved in a gear collapse accident in the 1990s and repainted deep red, so it is not as recognizable as Ze Plane of the television series when it was painted white.<br/><br/><br/><strong>fly</strong><strong>: </strong>Some flies have functional mandibles that may be used for biting.<br/>Flies are capable of great manoeuvrability during flight due to the presence of the halteres.<br/>Most adult diptera have their mouthparts modified to sponge up fluid.<br/>Some plants are pollinated by fungus feeding flies that visit fungus infected male flowers.<br/>The larvae of many brachyceran families are predaceous.<br/>Some aquatic larvae consume the films of algae that form underwater on rocks and plants.<br/>Fly larvae can be used as a biomedical tool for wound care and treatment.<br/>Many dipterans serve roles that are useful to humans.<br/>The wings of the fly are attached to two kinds of muscles, those used to power it and another set used for fine control.<br/>Flies are adapted for aerial movement and typically have short and streamlined bodies.<br/><br/><br/><strong>boeing</strong><strong>: </strong>This raised cockpit allows front loading of cargo on freight variants.<br/>The aircraft is certified to carry only essential crew and not passengers.<br/>The combi aircraft model, the 747-200M, could carry freight in the rear section of the main deck via a side cargo door.<br/>As the CX-HLS needed to be able to be loaded from the front, a door had to be included where the cockpit usually was.<br/>The main gear are redundant so that landing can be performed on two opposing landing gears if the others are not functioning properly.<br/>The 747 has redundant structures along with four redundant hydraulic systems and four main landing gears each with four wheels.<br/>The 747-300M features cargo capacity on the rear portion of the main deck, similar to the -200M, but with the stretched upper deck it can carry more passengers.<br/>Although the C-141 Starlifter was being introduced, officials believed that a much larger and more capable aircraft was needed, especially to carry cargo that would not fit in any existing aircraft.<br/>The -200C could also be outfitted with an optional side cargo door on the main deck.<br/>All of the companies solved this problem by moving the cockpit above the cargo area.<br/><br/><br/><strong>wide-body aircraft</strong><strong>: </strong>Some wide-body aircraft have been modified to enable transport of especially large cargo.<br/>Some wide-body aircraft are used as VIP transport.<br/>The Trent 900 is designed to fit into a Boeing 747-400F freighter for easier transport by air cargo.<br/>Complete GE90 engines can only be ferried by outsize cargo aircraft such as the Antonov An-124, presenting logistics problems if a 777 is stranded in a place due to emergency diversions without the proper spare parts.<br/>In some of the largest single-deck wide-body aircraft, such as the Boeing 777, the extra space above the cabin is used for crew rest areas and galley storage.<br/>Wide-body aircraft were originally designed for a combination of efficiency and passenger comfort and to increase the amount of cargo space.<br/>Super- and heavy-category aircraft require greater separation behind them than those in other categories.<br/>Larger aircraft would have to be longer, higher (such as a double-deck), or wider in order to accommodate a greater number of passenger seats.<br/>Some wide-body aircraft are used as flying command posts by the military like the Ilyushin Il-80 or the Boeing E-4, while the Boeing E-767 is used for Airborne Early Warning and Control.<br/>Most modern wide-body aircraft have two engines, although the heaviest wide-body aircraft are built with four engines: the Airbus A380, Boeing 747-8.<br/><br/><br/><strong>air travel</strong><strong>: </strong>Small piston engines can be modified to burn ethanol.<br/>Airlines rely either on the point-to-point model or the spoke-and-hub model to operate flights in between airports.<br/>Most air travel starts and ends at a commercial airport.<br/>Fish, macroinvertebrates and other aquatic organisms need sufficient dissolved oxygen levels in surface waters.<br/>A Continuous Descent Approach (CDA) is quieter as less noise is produced while the engines are near idle power.<br/>This argument in favor of air travel is counterweighted by two facts:.<br/>Higher bypass ratio engines produce less noise.<br/>For Collins Aerospace, this 1:50 ratio forbids electric propulsion for long-range aircraft.<br/>Modern air travel is much safer than road travel.<br/>Contrails are uncommon from lower-altitude aircraft.<br/><br/><br/><strong>this vehicle</strong><strong>: </strong>Most land vehicles rely on friction for accelerating, decelerating and changing direction.<br/>Continuous track is sometimes used instead of wheels to power land vehicles.<br/>Many pedalo boats also use paddle wheels for propulsion.<br/>Most vehicles, with the notable exception of railed vehicles, have at least one steering mechanism.<br/>Similarly to propeller vehicles, some vehicles use wings for propulsion.<br/>Land vehicles are classified broadly by what is used to apply steering and drive forces against the ground: wheeled, tracked, railed or skied.<br/>It is essential that a vehicle have a source of energy to drive it.<br/>Wheeled vehicles steer by angling their front or rear wheels.<br/>By far, most vehicles use wheels which employ the principle of rolling to enable displacement with very little rolling friction.<br/>If this is done with battery EVs, the interior heating requires extra energy from the vehicles' batteries.<br/><br/><br/><strong>airline</strong><strong>: </strong>Airlines usually prefer to purchase items visible to their passengers to differentiate themselves from local competitors.<br/>Airlines employ lawyers to deal with regulatory procedures and other administrative tasks.<br/>Most airlines employ a call sign that is normally spoken during airband radio transmissions.<br/>Early European airlines tended to favor comfort \u2013 the passenger cabins were often spacious with luxurious interiors \u2013 over speed and efficiency.<br/>The added efficiencies for these aircraft were often not in speed, but in passenger capacity, payload, and range.<br/>Some call signs are less obviously associated with a particular airline than others.<br/>Airlines assign prices to their services in an attempt to maximize profitability.<br/>Carriers often accomplish this by dividing each cabin of the aircraft (first, business and economy) into a number of travel classes for pricing purposes.<br/>Most airlines use differentiated pricing, a form of price discrimination, to sell air services at varying prices simultaneously to different segments.<br/>Airlines utilize aircraft to supply these services and may form partnerships or alliances with other airlines for codeshare agreements, in which they both offer and operate the same flight.<br/><br/><br/><strong>cargo</strong><strong>: </strong>You can see the different types and weights of vehicles that are used to move cargo around.<br/>Most nations own and utilize large numbers of military cargo aircraft such as the C\u201117 Globemaster III for logistical needs.<br/>Such large aircraft employ quick-loading containers known as unit load devices (ULDs), much like containerized cargo ships.<br/>Many firms, like Parcelforce, FedEx and R+L Carriers transport all types of cargo by road.<br/>Eventually manufacturers started designing aircraft for other types of freight as well.<br/>Popular commercial aircraft transformed to a cargo aircraft such as Saab 340A is designed for high revenue and profitability in short / medium haul operations.<br/>However, air freight or air cargo shipments typically need to move at much faster speeds than 800 km or 497 mi per hour.<br/>Aircraft were first used for carrying mail as cargo in 1911.<br/>Similarly, aircraft ULD boxes are also documented as cargo, with associated packing list of.<br/>Trains are capable of transporting a large number of containers that come from shipping ports.<br/><br/><br/><strong>white plane</strong><strong>: </strong>Mickey uses a turkey's tail as a tail for his plane.<br/>The POV shot from the plane made it appear as if the camera was tracking into the ground.<br/>A cow briefly \"rides\" the aircraft.<br/>After building his own airplane, he does a flight simulation to ensure that the plane is safe for flight but the flight fails, destroying the plane.<br/>The aircraft was later rented or sold to parties who later used it to smuggle drugs into the United States, and it crashed in a swamp on at least one occasion.<br/>The animated film is itself a general parody of the television series.<br/>It was one of the few Widgeons converted with radial engines.<br/>The sound effects are particularly appropriate on this type of film, and certainly add greatly to the comedy angle with the absurd squeaks, yawps and goofy noises.<br/>Ze Plane!

not considered a fault and the server may repeat the service attempt.<br/>It is commonly hit with the Continental grip or the Eastern backhand grip (using the forehand face of the racket).<br/>Players normally serve overhead, however serving underhand is allowed.<br/>this is not a legal serve in the major tours (but see below) although it is also not a fault.<br/>The underhand serve is struck below shoulder level.<br/>The term kick serve is ambiguous.<br/>It is hit with the opposite spin of the slice serve.<br/>A flat serve is hit with either a Continental grip (holding the racket as if it were

fault.<br/><br/><br/><strong>underhand</strong><strong>: </strong>also \"underhanded\".<br/>This is a highly specialized method of stoping requiring expert input.<br/>Stoping is considered \"productive work\", and is contrasted with \"deadwork\", the work required merely to access the mineral deposit, such as sinking shafts and winzes, carving adits, tunnels, and levels, and establishing ventilation and transportation.<br/>In overhand stoping, the deposit is worked from the bottom upward, the reverse of underhand stoping.<br/>Open stoping is generally divided into two basic forms based on direction: overhand and underhand stoping, which refer to the removal of ore from above or below the level, respectively.<br/>The stope may be backfilled or left empty, depending on the rock conditions.<br/>Like shrinkage stoping, underhand stoping is most suitable for steeply dipping ore bodies.<br/>A slot is required in every stope to provide the initial void.<br/>It is common to dig shafts vertically downwards to reach the ore body and then drive horizontal levels through it.<br/>Long hole stoping.<br/><br/><br/><strong>forehand</strong><strong>: </strong>It is particularly well-suited for hitting low balls \u2014 \"taking the ball on the rise\" \u2014 but is generally considered inferior for most forehands.<br/>It is often described as shaking hands with the racquet.<br/>Peng's forehand is also cross-handed.<br/>It is considered the easiest shot to master, perhaps because it is the most natural stroke.<br/>Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro is an excellent example of an eastern forehand user.<br/>It is currently the most popular forehand grip among ATP and WTA pros, with many top players employing this grip on their forehand.<br/>It contrasts with the backhand, the other type of groundstroke.<br/>There are four main grips for executing the forehand and their popularity has fluctuated over the years.<br/>It's considered by some to be too extreme for tennis, as the optimal strike zone for this grip is very high up and is suitable only for pure spin hitting.<br/>His power and versatility on the forehand side are commonly attributed to this twist on the forehand grip.<br/><br/><br/><strong>backhand</strong><strong>: </strong>It is considered hard to be able to consistently pull off deep, low yet quick backhand slices and requires much practice and finesse.<br/>The slice backhand is considered the most simple and is the easiest to learn technique-wise.<br/>The backhand is usually performed from the baseline or as an approach shot.<br/>It is usually executed with an Eastern or Semi-Western grip, and involves a \"throw-back\" in which the racket is pulled across the player's body, sometimes with the help of the left hand, and a release to hit the ball followed by a much larger follow-through and finish as compared to the slice backhand.<br/>Other female players are known for their use of the slice backhand.<br/>However, the two-handed backhand provides more stability and power for the shot, and is increasingly used in the modern game.<br/>The top-spin single-handed backhand is probably the hardest to learn.<br/>He was one of the first players to use a flat single-handed backhand with a hint of top-spin.<br/>The backhand can be a one-handed or two-handed stroke.<br/>Many tennis greats use the one-handed backhand.<br/><br/><br/><strong>consider</strong><strong>: </strong>The work was first published in the United States in 1941 and has been in print ever since.<br/>Fisher that deals in the history,

knot.<br/>It is often used to prevent the end of a rope from unraveling.<br/>If the two loose ends of an overhand knot are joined together (without creating additional crossings), this becomes equivalent to the trefoil knot of mathematical knot theory.<br/>In heraldry, the overhand knot is known as a \"Stafford knot\", owing to a representation of it being used first as a heraldic badge by

platform originally launched as invite-only.<br/>And started working  with the German based company Piabo.<br/>The service offers physical credit card readers designed to work with Stripe.<br/>In April 2018, the company released anti-fraud tools, branded \"Radar\", that block fraudulent transactions.<br/>Magnetic stripe, a method for storing data, such as on a credit card.<br/>The company

of all sizes.<br/>Plains in many areas are important for agriculture because where the soils were deposited as sediments they may be deep and fertile, and the flatness facilitates mechanization of crop production.<br/>Erosional plains have been leveled by various agents of denudation such as running water, rivers, wind and glacier which wear out the rugged surface and smoothens them.<br/>They are structurally depressed areas of the world that make up some of the most extensive natural lowlands on the Earth's surface.<br/>Plains are one of the major landforms on earth, where they are present on all continents, and would cover more than one-third of the world's land area.<br/>Glacial plains, formed by the movement of glaciers under the force of gravity:.<br/>Coastal plains would mostly rise from sea level until they run into elevated features such as mountains or plateaus.<br/>The chord progressions are played twice for all verses followed by the power chords D5-Gsus2-Bbsus2 for all choruses.<br/>Machair \u2013 A fertile low-lying grassy plain.<br/>Planitia, the Latin word for plain, is used in the naming of plains on extraterrestrial objects (planets and moons), such as Hellas Planitia on Mars or Sedna Planitia on Venus.<br/><br/><br/><strong>sleep</strong><strong>: </strong>Many cultural stories have been told about people falling asleep for extended periods of time.<br/>Some societies display a fragmented sleep pattern in which people sleep at all times of the day and night for shorter periods.<br/>Sleeping medications such as Ambien and Lunesta are an increasingly popular treatment for insomnia.<br/>Sleep is a highly conserved behavior across animal evolution.<br/>Process C counteracts the homeostatic drive for sleep during the day (in diurnal animals) and augments it at night.<br/>The use of artificial light has substantially altered humanity's sleep patterns.<br/>In many nomadic or hunter-gatherer societies, people will sleep on and off throughout the day or night depending on what is happening.<br/>In some societies, people sleep with at least one other person (sometimes many) or with animals.<br/>\" This theory is strengthened by the fact that sleep is observed to be a necessary behavior across most of the animal kingdom, including some of the least evolved animals which have no need for other functions of sleep, such as memory consolidation or dreaming.<br/>Bimodal sleep in humans was more common before the industrial revolution.<br/><br/><br/><strong>terrestrial animal</strong><strong>: </strong>Many animals considered terrestrial have a life-cycle that is partly dependent on being in water.<br/>They are adapted to most of the habitats on Earth.<br/>Many microscopic crustacean groups like copepods and amphipods (of which Sandhoppers are members) and Seed Shrimp are known to go dormant when dry and live in transient bodies of water too.<br/>Additionally many microscopic crustacean groups like copepods and amphipods (of which Sandhoppers are members) and Seed Shrimp are known to go dormant when dry and live in transient bodies of water.<br/>Many animals live in terrestrial environments by thriving in transient often microscopic bodies of water and moisture, these include Rotifers and Gastrotrichs which lay resilient eggs capable of surviving years in dry environments, and some of which can go dormant themselves.<br/>Saxicolous creatures are rock dwelling.<br/>Penguins, seals, and walruses sleep on land and feed in the ocean, yet they are all considered terrestrial.<br/>Gastropod mollusks are one of the most successful animals that have diversified in the fully terrestrial habitat.<br/>Labeling an animal species \"terrestrial\" or \"aquatic\" is often obscure and becomes a matter of judgment.<br/>The transition from an aquatic to terrestrial life has evolved independently and successfully many times by various groups of animals.<br/><br/><br/><strong>zebra</strong><strong>: </strong>The animals keep watch for predators.<br/>They are known for being among the last animals to be featured in the dictionary and in children's alphabet books where they are often used to represent the letter 'Z'.<br/>Plains zebras are adapted for grazing on both long, tough grass stems and newly emerging short grass.<br/>The zebra also gained a reputation for being ill-tempered and kicked at visitors.<br/>However, zebra young are afforded more protection then those of species like wildebeest and hartebeest.<br/>Zebras have been popular in photography, with some wildlife photographers describing them as the most photogenic animal.<br/>Plains zebras are more water-dependent and live in more mesic environments than other species.<br/>They regularly rub against trees, rocks, and other objects and roll around in dust for protection against flies and irritation.<br/>Their dentition is adapted for grazing.<br/>Zebra species have two basic social structures.<br/><br/><br/><strong>protection</strong><strong>: </strong>Both humans and animals are also often concerned with the protection of others, with adult animals being particularly inclined to seek to protect their young from elements of nature and from predators.<br/>Many animals supplement the protection afforded by their physiology by burrowing or otherwise adopting habitats or behaviors that insulate them from potential sources of harm.<br/>Additional structures like scales and hair offer further protection from the elements and from predators, with some animals having features such as spines or camouflage serving exclusively as anti-predator adaptations.<br/>Biological membranes such as bark on trees and skin on animals offer protection from various threats, with skin playing a key role in protecting organisms against pathogens and excessive water loss.<br/>Humans originally began wearing clothing and building shelters in prehistoric times for protection from the elements.<br/>In computer sciences the separation of protection and security is a design choice.<br/>Some kind of protection is a characteristic of all life, as living things have evolved at least some protective mechanisms to counter damaging environmental phenomena, such as ultraviolet light.<br/>The meaning of the word protection, as used in the electrical industry, is no different to that in everyday use.<br/>In the human sphere of activity, the concept of protection has been extended to nonliving objects, including technological systems such as computers, and to intangible things such as intellectual property, beliefs, and economic systems.<br/>The ratings for water ingress are not cumulative beyond IPX6.<br/><br/><br/><strong>these animals</strong><strong>: </strong>Some animals are capable of asexual reproduction, which often results in a genetic clone of the parent.<br/>Several animals are microscopic.<br/>Most animals rely on the biomass and energy produced by plants through photosynthesis.<br/>A wide variety of terrestrial and aquatic animals are hunted for sport.<br/>Working animals including cattle and horses have been used for work and transport from the first days of agriculture.<br/>Several animal phyla lack bilateral symmetry.<br/>Marine fish of many species are caught commercially for food.<br/>Other animals may have very specific feeding behaviours, such as hawksbill sea turtles primarily eating sponges.<br/>Nearly all animals make use of some form of sexual reproduction.<br/>All animals are composed of cells, surrounded by a characteristic extracellular matrix composed of collagen and elastic glycoproteins.<br/><br/><br/><strong>zoo</strong><strong>: </strong>Sometimes animals are unable to perform certain behaviors in zoos, like seasonal migration or traveling over large distances.<br/>The animals were moved to the London Zoo when it opened.<br/>Some behaviors are seen as essential for an animal's welfare whilst others aren't.<br/>A large number of animals are culled each year in zoos, but this is controversial.<br/>Zoo animals live in enclosures that often attempt to replicate their natural habitats or behavioral patterns, for the benefit of both the animals and visitors.<br/>Especially in large animals, a limited number of spaces are available in zoos.<br/>The animals may be trained to perform tricks, and visitors are able to get closer to them than in larger zoos.<br/>Nocturnal animals are often housed in buildings with a reversed light-dark cycle, i.<br/>Modern zoos also aim to help teach visitors the importance on animal conservation, often through letting visitors witness the animals firsthand.<br/>The welfare of zoo animals varies widely.<br/><br/><br/><strong>lion</strong><strong>: </strong>Lions are not particularly known for their stamina.<br/>Lions are part of a group of exotic animals that have been central to zoo exhibits since the late 18th century.<br/>These deities were often connected with the sun god Ra and his fierce heat, and their dangerous power was invoked to guard people or sacred places.<br/>the animal's expressive movements are highly developed.<br/>The lion's repertoire of vocalisations is large.<br/>Another 11 animals thought to be Barbary lions kept in Addis Ababa Zoo are descendants of animals owned by Emperor Haile Selassie.<br/>Lion cubs are born blind.<br/>The lion is one of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture.<br/>In parts of West and East Africa, the lion is associated with healing and is regarded as the link between seers and the supernatural.<br/>Lion populations are untenable outside designated protected areas.<br/><br/><br/>", "concept":

designed to carry trucks and/or semi-trailers.<br/>Types of freight cars.<br/>Slate wagon: specialized freight cars used to transport slate.<br/>Passenger cars can take the electricity supply for heating and lighting equipment from either of two main sources: directly from a head end power generator on the locomotive via bus cables, or by an axle-powered generator which continuously charges batteries whenever the train is in motion.<br/>Many multiple unit trains consist of cars which are semi-permanently coupled into sets: these sets may be joined together to form larger trains, but generally passengers can only move around between cars within a set.<br/>Such cars, when coupled together and hauled by one or more locomotives, form a train.<br/>Often, but not always, passenger cars in a train are linked together with enclosed, flexible gangway connections through which passengers and crewmen can walk.<br/>Long-distance trains often require baggage cars for the passengers' luggage.<br/><br/><br/><strong>passenger</strong><strong>: </strong>Passenger car (rail), railway rolling stock for carrying passengers.<br/>Passenger car (Ferris wheel), a compartment for carrying

locations such as ports and cities.<br/>For example, no-pax flights are freight, ferry, repositioning cruises and positioning flights.<br/>Many places require cars to be outfitted with measures specifically for the protection of passengers, such as passenger-side air bags.<br/>A revenue passenger is someone who has paid a transport operator for her or his trip.<br/>On long-distance buses and trains (and some planes), passengers may board and disembark at intermediate stops, in which case RPMs/RPKs have to be calculated for each segment if a careful total is needed.<br/><br/><br/><strong>vehicle</strong><strong>: </strong>Electrified trains were used for coal transport, as the motors did not use precious oxygen in the mines.<br/>Electric ferries operate routinely.<br/>1961 Vostok vehicle carried the first human, Yuri Gagarin, into space.<br/>These linear motors are used in maglev trains which float above the rails supported by magnetic levitation.<br/>There are also battery electric passenger trains operating on non-electrified rail lines.<br/>Commercial licenses that allow the transport of passengers and cargo are more tightly regulated.<br/>High-speed trains sometimes use frictionless Eddy-current brakes.<br/>Passenger aircraft carry a great deal of safety equipment including inflatable slides are rafts, oxygen masks,

12,000 tons of coal per trip.<br/>Most open cast mines in the United States extract bituminous coal.<br/>Conveyors transport the removed coal from the seam.<br/>The continuous miner shears coal panels 150 to 200 feet (45 to 60 metres) wide and more than a half-mile (1 km) long, having regard to factors such as geological strata.<br/>Some coal-mining regions are highly dependent on coal.<br/>The loosened coal falls onto an armored chain conveyor or pan line that takes the coal to the conveyor belt for removal from the work area.<br/>Water systems are affected by coal mining.<br/>This block of

International), which in the same year held 11 percent of the U.<br/>The Coca-Cola Company has historically been considered PepsiCo's primary competitor in the beverage market, and in December 2005, PepsiCo surpassed The Coca-Cola Company in market value for the first time in 12 years since both companies began to compete.<br/>The main recipients of grants as part of the refresh project are community organizations with a local focus and nonprofit organizations, such as a high school in Michigan that\u2014as a result of being selected in 2010\u2014received $250,000 towards construction of a fitness room.<br/>One of the American products exhibited was Pepsi Cola.<br/>The primary identifier of a food and beverage industry main brand is annual sales over $1 billion.<br/>In comparison, Coca-Cola is the fourth most popular carbonated drink, occupying a mere 8.<br/>His role in the advertisements is to appear with Pepsi to thirsty people or people craving soda.<br/>The theory has been advanced that New Coke, as the reformulated drink came to be known, was invented specifically in response to the Pepsi Challenge.<br/>once people's supply of bottle caps ran out, the only way they could get more was to buy more Pepsi.<br/><br/><br/><strong>the drink</strong><strong>: </strong>A persistent problem in the soft drinks industry was the lack of an effective sealing of the bottles.<br/>Another early type of soft drink was lemonade, made of water and lemon juice sweetened with honey, but without carbonated water.<br/>The origins of soft drinks lie in the development of fruit-flavored drinks.<br/>The effect of coffee on human health has been a subject of many studies.<br/>The most popular varieties internationally are soy milk, almond milk, rice milk and coconut milk.<br/>Regarded as one of the \"original\" drinks, milk is the primary source of nutrition for babies.<br/>Some drinks, such as wine, can be used as an alternative investment.<br/>Of most importance is that the ingredient meets the agreed specification on all major parameters.<br/>One well-known example is the rum and coke, which may also contain lime juice.<br/>In other situations, the drinkware has practical application, such as coffee cups which are designed for insulation or brandy snifters which are designed to encourage evaporation but trap the aroma within the glass.<br/><br/><br/><strong>plastic bottle</strong><strong>: </strong>The main difference between each type of water bottle is the flexibility of the material.<br/>The lowest impact water bottles are those made of glass or metal.<br/>However, the biggest advantage plastic bottles have over their glass counterparts is their superior resistance to breakage, in both production and transportation.<br/>An alternate benefit is minimizing storage, transportation, or disposal space when the bottle is empty or as the content is being dispersed, for example with water bottles used by hikers.<br/>The use of a water bottle allows an individual to drink and transport a beverage from one place to another.<br/>HDPE is the most widely used resin for plastic bottles.<br/>Inhalation of chemicals used in the manufacture of plastics is a hazard for the factory workers who handle the material.<br/>Except for wine and beer, the food industry has almost completely replaced glass bottles with plastic bottles.<br/>However, the popularity and availability of disposable plastic water bottles continues to rise.<br/>The materials used in the manufacture of plastic bottles vary by application.<br/><br/><br/><strong>the main rival</strong><strong>: </strong>Shang Tsung is usually portrayed as the right-hand man of series archvillain Shao Kahn and the main rival and archenemy of Liu Kang.<br/>He is interested in simplicity in the recording and with the sound and vitality of real musicians in a room.<br/>The initial history of the character was explained in the 1992 Midway-produced comic book based on the original MK game, in which he was the first-ever Mortal Kombat (then the Shaolin Tournament) champion over 500 years ago from the date of the then-current tournament depicted in the actual game, yet he was stricken with a curse that forced him to consume the souls of his defeated opponents in order to keep his youth.<br/>The original idea was that Shang Tsung was a human traitor who had sold his soul.<br/>The union of Holiday, Buchanan, Everhart and Miley led to the formation of Rival Sons.<br/>Iron Shogun is eventually declared the tournament winner when he kills a pizza deliveryman who unwittingly enters the arena.<br/>Cobb encourages and captures the vocal punch of the band's mainman, Jay Buchanan.<br/>Shang Tsung plays his original role of the main antagonist in the first series of the Malibu Comics' Blood & Thunder miniseries, with his backstory mostly unchanged as an old man serving Shao Kahn to open the portal through 10 consecutive Mortal Kombat wins.<br/>Here's someone about to descend and doesn't know what they'll face, or where this might lead.<br/>Additionally, Shang Tsung is mentioned by name in several mirror-match introductions as a possible explanation as to why the characters fight themselves.<br/><br/><br/><strong>blue wall</strong><strong>: </strong>One method of minimising the effects of the blue wall of silence is exposing those who follow it.<br/>There are also forces that work against the code and promote whistleblowing.<br/>Another reason officers may hesitate to go against the blue code may be that challenging the blue code would mean challenging long-standing traditions and feelings of brotherhood within the institution.<br/>Many states have taken measures in police academies to promote the exposure of the blue code.<br/>The low number of officers coming forward may have to do with the understanding that things happen in the heat of the moment that some officers would rather keep personal.<br/>Several campaigns against the blue code of silence or for making it more visible in the public eye have taken place in the United States.<br/>\"  The earliest description of the forces creating the blue wall comes from a Houston Chronicle blogger, Chris Ladd.<br/>Trump's lone breakthrough in the \"blue wall\" in 2020 was the one electoral vote from Maine, which he again won.<br/>The police department is only responsible for preventing corruption among officers.<br/>Some words used to describe these values are as follows: a sense of mission, action, cynicism, pessimism, machismo, suspicion, conservatism, isolation and solidarity.<br/><br/><br/><strong>wine</strong><strong>: </strong>The main active ingredient of wine is alcohol, and therefore, the health effects of alcohol apply to wine.<br/>The main corporate sponsor of Wine is CodeWeavers, which employs Julliard and many other Wine developers to work on Wine and on CrossOver, CodeWeavers' supported version of Wine.<br/>Later, the descendants of the sacramental wine were refined for a more palatable taste.<br/>In fine restaurants in Western countries, wine typically accompanies dinner.<br/>Alcoholic drinks, including wine, are forbidden under most interpretations of Islamic law.<br/>An alternative for installing Internet Explorer directly is to use the now-defunct IEs4Linux.<br/>The most common wines purchased for investment include those from Bordeaux and Burgundy.<br/>As long as the primary substance fermented is honey, the drink is considered mead.<br/>The use of wine in ancient Near Eastern and Ancient Egyptian religious ceremonies was common.<br/>Some people are drawn to canned wine due to its portability and recyclable packaging.<br/><br/><br/><strong>juice</strong><strong>: </strong>One of the first regularly produced juices was lemonade, appearing in 16th-century Italy, as an import, after its conception in the Middle East.<br/>\"No added sugar\" is commonly printed on labels of juice containers, but the products may contain large amounts of naturally occurring sugars.<br/>The largest fruit juice consumers are New Zealand (nearly a cup, or 8 ounces, each day) and Colombia (more than three quarters of a cup each day).<br/>High intensity pulsed electric fields are being used as an alternative to heat pasteurization in fruit juices.<br/>Processing time of the juice is calculated by multiplying the number of pulses with the effective pulse duration.<br/>In Mexico, juice bars have become more popular in the 2000s.<br/>The term \"juice drink\" is not defined in the Regulations and can be used to describe any drink which includes juice, whatever the amount.<br/>5 percent, and set taxes on fruit juices based on the alcohol content of the drink.<br/>In addition, the use of PEF results in minimal detrimental effects on the quality of the food.<br/>According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the term \"nectar\" is generally accepted in the US and in international trade for a diluted juice to denote a beverage that contains fruit juice or puree, water, and artificial sweeteners.<br/><br/><br/><strong>face</strong><strong>: </strong>The bones involved in shaping the face are mainly the maxilla, mandible, nasal bone and zygomatic bone.<br/>The face is a part of the body, the front of the head.<br/>Facial shape is an important determinant of beauty, particularly facial symmetry.<br/>The shape of the face is influenced by the bone-structure of the skull, and each face is unique through the anatomical variation present in the bones of the viscerocranium (and neurocranium).<br/>By extension, anything which is the forward or world-facing part of a system which has internal structure is considered its \"face\", like the fa\u00e7ade of a building.<br/>The muscles of the face play a prominent role in the expression of emotion, and vary among different individuals, giving rise to additional diversity in expression and facial features.<br/>The pattern of specific organs, such as the eyes, or of parts of them, is used in biometric identification to uniquely identify individuals.<br/>The front of the human head is called the face.<br/>The face is the feature which best distinguishes a person.<br/>For example, a public relations or press officer might be called the \"face\" of the organization he or she represents.<br/><br/><br/><strong>milk</strong><strong>: </strong>The most durable form of milk is powdered milk, which is produced from milk by removing almost all water.<br/>Another significant and popular addition to the marketplace has been flavored milks.<br/>Sweetened milk is a drink popular with students of all ages and is often sold in small plastic bags complete with straw.<br/>A significant addition to the marketplace has been \"long-life\" milk (UHT), generally available in 1 and 2 liter rectangular cardboard cartons.<br/>Two of the main reasons for the decline of UK home deliveries by milkmen are household refrigerators (which lessen the need for daily milk deliveries) and private car usage (which has increased supermarket shopping).<br/>The largest structures in the fluid portion of the milk are \"casein micelles\": aggregates of several thousand protein molecules with superficial resemblance to a surfactant micelle, bonded with the help of nanometer-scale particles of calcium phosphate.<br/>The standard unit of measuring milk quantity in Kenya is a liter.<br/>The most common flavors, besides the natural presentation, are chocolate, strawberry and vanilla.<br/>As seen in China, sweetened and flavored milk drinks are commonly seen in vending machines.<br/>A side effect of the heating of pasteurization is that some vitamin and mineral content is lost.<br/><br/><br/><strong>hand</strong><strong>: </strong>The primary function of the extensors is to straighten out the digits.<br/>A common fracture of the hand is a scaphoid fracture\u2014a fracture of the scaphoid bone, one of the carpal bones.<br/>A reliable way of identifying human hands is from the presence of opposable thumbs.<br/>The thumb is undoubtedly the \"master digit\" of the hand, giving value to all the other fingers.<br/>The neural machinery underlying hand movements is a major contributing factor.<br/>There are several cutaneous conditions that can affect the hand including the nails.<br/>Another common fracture, known as Boxer's fracture, is to the neck of a metacarpal.<br/>The recent evolution of the human hand is thus a direct result of the development of the central nervous system, and the hand, therefore, is a direct tool of our consciousness \u2014 the main source of differentiated tactile sensations \u2014 and a precise working organ enabling gestures \u2014 the expressions of our personalities.<br/>The muscles acting on the hand can be subdivided into two groups: the extrinsic and intrinsic muscle groups.<br/>The web of the hand is a \"fold of skin which connects the digits\".<br/><br/><br/><strong>table</strong><strong>: </strong>The relationship of the f-block to the other blocks of the periodic table also becomes easier to see.<br/>The chemistries of the two categories of metals resemble one another to a large degree.<br/>A common alternative is at the top of group 17 given hydrogen's strictly univalent and largely non-metallic chemistry, and the strictly univalent and non-metallic chemistry of fluorine (the element otherwise at the top of group 17).<br/>The position of hydrogen in group 1 is reasonably well settled.<br/>they behave as if they were located on the left side of the table.<br/>The property that distinguishes helium from the rest of the noble gases is that in its closed electron shell, helium has only two electrons in the outermost electron orbital, while the rest of the noble gases have eight.<br/>A majority of nonmetals are colored or colorless insulating gases.<br/>Another consequence is the increased metallicity of the following elements in a block after the first kainosymmetric orbital, along with a preference for higher oxidation states.<br/>The bifurcation of group 3 is a throwback to the Mendeleev eight column-form in which seven of the main groups each have two subgroups.<br/>The recognition and acceptance afforded to Mendeleev's table came from two decisions he made.<br/><br/><br/><strong>man</strong><strong>: </strong>Another significant hormone in sexual differentiation is the anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone, which inhibits the development of the M\u00fcllerian ducts.<br/>The actual determining factor is the SRY gene, which is normally found on the Y chromosome.<br/>This difference in the relative amounts of these sex steroids is largely responsible for the physiological differences that distinguish men from women.<br/>In all cultures in the past, and still among traditional and non-Western cultures, getting married is the most common and definitive distinction between boyhood and manhood.<br/>This difference in the relative amounts of these sex steroids is responsible for the physiological differences that distinguish men from women.<br/>The male reproductive system's function is to produce semen, which carries sperm and thus genetic information that can unite with an egg within a woman.<br/>Most expressions of sexual dimorphism in humans are found in height, weight, and body structure, though there are always examples that do not follow the overall pattern.<br/>In mammals, the hormones that influence sexual differentiation and development are androgens (mainly testosterone), which stimulate later development of the ovary.<br/>In Western culture, for example, greater masculinity usually brings greater social status.<br/>In human beings, the sex of an individual is determined at the time of fertilization by the genetic material carried in the sperm cell.<br/><br/><br/><strong>tea</strong><strong>: </strong>The popular green tea called kahwah is often served after every meal in the Pashtun belt of Balochistan and in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.<br/>One form of Chinese tea ceremony is the Gongfu tea ceremony, which typically uses small Yixing clay teapots and oolong tea.<br/>But, unquestionably, the feature of Compo rations destined to be remembered beyond all others is Compo tea.<br/>The order of steps in preparing a cup of tea is a much-debated topic and can vary widely between cultures or even individuals.<br/>Examples of additions added at the point of consumption include milk, sugar and lemon.<br/>It is the most common beverage of households in the region.<br/>It is customary for a host to offer tea to guests soon after their arrival.<br/>There are many different types of tea.<br/>The addition of milk to tea in Europe was first mentioned in 1680 by the epistolist Madame de S\u00e9vign\u00e9.<br/>Compressed tea was the most popular form of tea in China during the Tang dynasty.<br/><br/><br/><strong>raising cane's chicken fingers</strong><strong>: </strong>The chain first began expanding internationally in 2015, opening its first restaurant in Kuwait.<br/>The namesake mascot is not seen on signage and merchandise, as dogs are not popular in Kuwait.<br/>The current dog is Raising Cane III, adopted in January 2018.<br/>Raising Cane's offers a limited menu consisting of five main combos: the \"Box Combo,\" the \"3 Finger Combo,\" the \"Caniac Combo,\" the \"Kids Combo,\" and the \"Sandwich Combo.<br/>The business plan was rejected numerous times by potential investors, so Graves earned the needed money  working as a boilermaker in a Los Angeles refinery and fishing for sockeye salmon in Alaska.<br/>The two couldn't persuade bankers to fund the restaurant idea, so Graves worked at a refinery and then joined Silvey as a salmon fisherman to raise the money to open the first restaurant, which opened right outside the north gates of Louisiana State University on Highland Road in 1996.<br/>He and Silvey obtained a SBA loan which they used to open the first restaurant in Baton Rouge.<br/>While employed at Guthrie's, Graves's boss was Roddy Smith.<br/>The project received a C- in the class, and the professor commented that a chicken-fingers-only business could never succeed.<br/>The restaurants are named after Graves' dog.<br/><br/><br/><strong>coffee</strong><strong>: </strong>The best (but least used) method of drying coffee is using drying tables.<br/>The next step in the process is the roasting of the green coffee.<br/>The roasting process influences the taste of the beverage by changing the coffee bean both physically and chemically.<br/>The traditional method of planting coffee is to place 20 seeds in each hole at the beginning of the rainy season.<br/>A contemporary example of religious prohibition of coffee can be found in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.<br/>Paralleling (and complementing) the rapid rise of instant coffee was the coffee vending machine invented in 1947 and widely distributed since the 1950s.<br/>The tendency of coffee to absorb strong smells from food means that it should be kept away from such smells.<br/>The organization regards the consumption of coffee as both physically and spiritually unhealthy.<br/>The caffeine content of a cup of coffee varies depending mainly on the brewing method, and also on the coffee variety.<br/>Bottled coffee drinks are also consumed in the United States.<br/><br/><br/><strong>the table</strong><strong>:

significant distances, often in excess of 15 km.<br/>the potential operator pool for all buses is much larger than for trams.<br/>A switch may be either in a \"straight through\" or \"turnout\" position.<br/>A Selectric switch has a similar design, but the contacts on the wires are skewed, often at a 45-degree angle, rather than being lined up.<br/>(The contacts are lined up on the wires in this case.<br/>Trolleybuses are quieter than internal combustion engine vehicles.<br/>The main advantages of this technology over conventional battery electric buses are reduced cost and weight of the battery due to its smaller size, no delays for charging at end stops as the vehicle charges while in motion and reduced need for dedicated charging stations that take up public space.<br/>The receiver is attached to the switch and causes it to trigger if the correct code is received.<br/>Two wires, and two trolley poles, are required to complete the electrical circuit.<br/><br/><br/><strong>transport</strong><strong>: </strong>The locomotive weight was 95 tonnes and the power was 883 kW with a maximum speed of 100 km/h.<br/>Private transport is only subject

vehicle</strong><strong>: </strong>The power of a vehicle's electric motor, as in other vehicles, is measured in kilowatts (kW).<br/>Steel wheels on steel tracks are lower still.<br/>In cold climates, considerable energy is needed to heat the interior of a vehicle and to defrost the windows.<br/>Paddle wheels are used on some older watercraft and their reconstructions.<br/>The carbon footprint and other emissions of electric vehicles varies depending on the fuel and technology used for electricity generation.<br/>An auxiliary combustion engine is used only to supplement battery charging and not as the primary source of power.<br/>Some nozzles are intangible, such as the electromagnetic field nozzle of a vectored ion thruster.<br/>The largest vehicle in the world, the Bagger 288, is propelled by continuous tracks.<br/>The prices of lithium-ion batteries are constantly decreasing, contributing to a reduction in price for electric vehicles.<br/>so minimising frictional losses is very important in many vehicles.<br/><br/><br/><strong>buddy's pizza</strong><strong>: </strong>Randazzo says that the crust should be about 1.<br/>The buttery flavor of the crust results from a small quantity of oil and the melting properties of the mozzarella and Wisconsin brick cheeses.<br/>Some 50- to 75-year-old pans are still in use.<br/>The brick cheese can withstand the heat due to the heavy butterfat content.<br/>This edge, known as frico, is the crispy caramelized cheese that runs along the edges of Detroit-style pizzas.<br/>5 inches thick for true Detroit-style pizza.<br/>Strong growth on menus is predicted for the next four years and Detroit-style pizza is ranked in the 90th percentile for growth potential.<br/>The original location is still in business at 17125 Conant Street in Detroit.<br/>The dough typically has a hydration level of 70 percent or higher, which creates an open, porous, chewy crust with a crisp exterior.<br/>One positive review with three tasters featured compliments about the \"thick, fluffy, chewy crust\".<br/><br/><br/><strong>tag</strong><strong>: </strong>Electronic tagging, a form of non-surreptitious surveillance using a device attached

in a highball glass and garnished with an orange slice.<br/>A Sex on the Beach is an alcoholic cocktail containing vodka, peach schnapps, orange juice and cranberry juice.<br/>A \"sex in the driveway\" is a sex on the beach with orange juice and cranberry juice replaced with blue cura\u00e7ao and Sprite.<br/>There are two general types of the cocktail:.<br/>Boston Official Bartender's Guide (67th edition) provides an alternative recipe made from vodka, Chambord, Midori Melon Liqueur, pineapple juice, and cranberry juice.<br/>The Louis Armstrong version was recorded in the key of C major, but it has been recorded in a range of keys.<br/>The alcohol-free variation is sometimes referred to as \"Safe Sex on the Beach,\" \"Cuddles on the Beach,\" or \"Virgins on the Beach\".<br/>Some derivative variations have their own names:.<br/><br/><br/><strong>the windshield</strong><strong>: </strong>Some vehicles have noticeably more tint in the uppermost part of the windshield to block sunglare.<br/>Early windshields were made of ordinary window glass, but that could lead to serious injuries in the event of a crash.<br/>The urethane sealant is protected from UV in sunlight by a band of dark dots called a frit around the edge of the windshield.<br/>Aircraft windshields are designed in such a way that even if a crack were to extend all the way across the panel, the structural integrity is maintained via multiple failsafe methods in both frame and the glass plies.<br/>on inside of the windshield.<br/>Aero screens are usually less than 20 cm (8 inches) in height.<br/>If a crack extends to the edge of the panel then this would compromise the structural integrity of the windshield.<br/>Modern windshields are generally made of laminated safety glass, a type of treated glass, which consists of, typically, two curved sheets of glass with a plastic layer laminated between them for safety, and bonded into the window frame.<br/>The hardened glass shattered into many mostly harmless fragments when the windshield broke.<br/>The term windscreen is the usual term in the British Isles and Australasia for all vehicles.<br/><br/><br/><strong>hop</strong><strong>: </strong>A heating unit on the lower floor is used to dry the hops.<br/>Hop houses are two-story buildings, of which the upper story has a slatted floor covered with burlap.<br/>The composition of hop essential oils can differ between varieties and between years in the same variety, having a significant influence on flavour and aroma.<br/>Hop bars were used before modern machinery was invented to make the holes for the hop poles.<br/>The principal production centres in the UK are in Kent (which produces Kent Goldings hops), Herefordshire, and Worcestershire.<br/>The degree of bitterness imparted by hops depends on the degree to which alpha acids are isomerized during the boil, and the impact of a given amount of hops is specified in International Bitterness Units.<br/>Hop plants are planted in rows about 2 to 2.<br/>The cones grow high on the bine, and in the past, these cones were picked by hand.<br/>Gruit was used when the nobility levied taxes on hops.<br/>The hop plant's reproduction method is that male and female flowers develop on separate plants, although occasionally a fertile individual will develop which contains both male and female flowers.<br/><br/><br/>", "concept": "<strong>tour bus service</strong><strong>: </strong><br/><br/><strong>land vehicle</strong><strong>: </strong>military

</strong>The purpose of using beer is so the bubbles in the beer will add body and lightness to the batter.<br/>Depending on the type and quality of the beer, beer may also add colour or some flavour to the batter.<br/>Some foods that are commonly beer battered and fried are fish, chips, and onion rings.<br/>The ideal batter for fried foods is to be thick enough to adhere to the food, but not so thick as to become heavy.<br/>The practice of beer battering is popular in Australia, New Zealand, the United States, Britain, Ireland, Germany, Iceland and Russia.<br/>One reason is that a basic batter can be made from merely flour, beer, and some salt.<br/>Many other flavourings such as herbs, spices, fruits or vegetables may be added to the mixture.<br/>Batter is most often used for

normal approach in an attempt to \"make up for it\" by striking out the next batter with some fastballs.<br/>Simple back-to-back home runs are a relatively frequent occurrence.<br/>The term \"four-run homer\" is seldom used.<br/>Unlike with an outside-the-park home run, the batter-runner and all preceding runners are liable to be put out by the defensive team at any time while running the bases.<br/>Therefore, inside-the-park home runs are now rare.<br/>Then he hit his three home runs on the first pitch of his next three at bats, off of three different pitchers (4th inning- Hooten, 5th

next time each player rotates will be after the other team wins possession of the ball and loses the point.<br/>When a bowler bowls a no-ball, the immediate next ball is a free hit.<br/>when the only player on the server's team to touch the ball is the server.<br/>In this situation, the player makes use of a specific rolling technique to minimize the chances of injuries.<br/>in this case the umpire is required to signal the free hit again.<br/>Sometimes a player may also be forced to drop their body quickly to the floor to save the ball.<br/>Ideally, the contact with the ball is made at the apex of the hitter's jump.<br/>When one player is ready to serve, some teams will line up their other five players in a screen to obscure the view of the receiving team.<br/>The big advantage of this system is that the setter always has 3 hitters to vary sets with.<br/>The attack, also known as the spike, is usually the third contact a team makes with the

does not necessarily mean that most people won't agree on which notes are higher and lower.<br/>Complex and aperiodic sound waves can often be assigned a pitch by this method.<br/>The jnd is typically tested by playing two tones in quick succession with the listener asked if there was a difference in their pitches.<br/>The pitch of complex tones can be ambiguous, meaning that two or more different pitches can be perceived, depending upon the observer.<br/>As a result, musicians need a way to refer to a particular pitch in an unambiguous manner when talking to each other.<br/>The jnd becomes smaller if the two tones are played simultaneously as the listener is then able to discern beat frequencies.<br/>The system is flexible enough to include \"microtones\" not found on standard piano keyboards.<br/>Not all musical instruments make notes with a clear pitch.<br/>A sound generated on any instrument produces many modes of vibration that occur simultaneously.<br/>It is still possible

</strong>It appears that men in westernized societies are more influenced by female waist size than hip size:.<br/>The methods include the use of a corset to reduce the waist size and hip and buttock padding to increase the apparent size of the hips and buttocks.<br/>\"Blind men prefer a low waist-to-hip ratio\".<br/>It was predicted that the effect of breast size on judgment of attractiveness and age estimation would be dependent on overall body fat and the size of the waist-to-hip ratio.<br/>The three sizes are used mostly in fashion, and almost exclusively in reference to women, who, compared to men, are more likely to have a narrow waist relative to bust and hips.<br/>An important difference exists when measuring men's hips for most fashion design purposes.<br/>For example, a person with a 30\u2033 (76 cm) waist and 38\u2033 (97 cm) hips has a waist-hip ratio of about 0.<br/>the normal range of female WHR was often higher than in western cultures,.<br/>In these instances,

visible.<br/>This allows the viewer to see themselves or objects behind them, or even objects that are at an angle from them but out of their field of view, such as around a corner.<br/>This effect

deformation.<br/>To move this defect (plastically deforming or yielding the material), a larger stress must be applied.<br/>When a metal is subjected to large plastic deformations the grain sizes and orientations change in the direction of deformation.<br/>However, for critical situations, tension testing is done to eliminate ambiguity.<br/>Engineering metals display strain hardening, which implies that the yield stress is increased after unloading from a yield state.<br/>If a metal is only stressed to the upper yield point, and beyond, L\u00fcders bands can develop.<br/>High strength steel and aluminum alloys do not exhibit a yield point, so this offset yield point is used on these materials.<br/>Below the yield point, a material will deform elastically and will return to its original shape when the applied stress is removed.<br/>In some materials, such as aluminium, there is a gradual onset of non-linear behavior, making the precise yield point difficult to determine.<br/>Where a buildup of dislocations at a grain boundary causes a repulsive force between dislocations.<br/><br/><br/><strong>enter</strong><strong>: </strong>At the end of the first day,

viewed as a population of individuals.<br/>In the United States, determining whether a work has entered the public domain or is still under copyright can be quite complex, primarily because copyright terms have been extended multiple times and in different ways\u2014shifting over the course of the 20th century from a fixed-term based on first publication, with a possible renewal term, to a term extending to 50, then 70, years after the death of the author.<br/>The museum claimed that the photos were taken by their staff, and that photography within the museum by visitors was prohibited.<br/>However, the usage of the term public domain can be more granular, including for example uses of works in copyright permitted by copyright exceptions.<br/>So, in this perspective, the public is still a fundamental notion to social life although in a different manner in comparison to 18th century Public Sphere's Public.<br/>Therefore, photos taken by the museum, even of material that itself had fallen into the public domain, were protected by copyright law and would need to be removed from the Wikimedia image repository.<br/>According to James Boyle this definition underlines common usage of the term public domain and equates the public domain to public property and works in copyright to private property.<br/>The Unlicense, published around 2010, has a focus on an

ocean.<br/>As it is thought that life evolved in the ocean, the diversity of life is immense, including:.<br/>The phrases \"the ocean\" or \"the sea\" used without specification refer to the interconnected body of salt water covering the majority of the Earth's surface.<br/>Thus, oceanic waters in polar regions have lower salinity content than oceanic waters in temperate and tropical regions.<br/>As a general term, \"the ocean\" is mostly interchangeable with \"the sea\" in American English, but not in British English.<br/>The word \"sea\" can also be used for many specific, much smaller bodies of seawater, such as the North Sea or the Red Sea.<br/>They feed on marine animals and spend most of their lifetime on water, many only going on land for breeding.<br/>Strictly speaking, a sea is a body of water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land.<br/>Seven species of turtles, the sea turtles, also spend most of their time in the

the lifeguard shack and toss them at different ends of the beach to find out the extent of the creature under the sand.<br/>Once there is a sufficient amount of sand, the beach acts as a barrier to keep the land from eroding any further.<br/>Not only does this affect marine life, but also the local fishing industries because of the loss of life, and communities living close to the water's edge.<br/>Weathering and river deposition also accelerate the process of creating a beach, along with marine animals interacting with rocks, such as eating the algae off of them.<br/>When sand is taken out of the water it increases the risk of landslides, which can lead to loss of agricultural land and/or damage to dwellings.<br/>A beach patrolman drives onto the beach.<br/><br/><br/><strong>a lake</strong><strong>: </strong>Lake Enriquillo in Dominican Republic is the only saltwater lake in the world inhabited by crocodiles.<br/>They include maritime coastal lakes, ordinarily in drowned estuaries.<br/>Conversely, peat soils in a marsh can naturally burn and reverse this process to recreate a shallow lake resulting in a dynamic equilibrium between marsh and lake.<br/>The deepest layer of water in such a lake does not contain any dissolved oxygen.<br/>Since the surface water of deep tropical lakes never reaches the temperature of maximum density, there is no process that makes the water mix.<br/>In the daytime a lake can cool the land beside it with local winds, resulting in a sea breeze.<br/>In very shallow water bodies, iron oxides make water reddish brown.<br/>Therefore, lake organisms can often be studied in isolation from the lake's surroundings.<br/>However, this typical stratification sequence can vary widely depending either on the specific lake, the time of season, or combination of both.<br/>of dissolved and suspended material in a lake.<br/><br/><br/><strong>green umbrella</strong><strong>: </strong>Larger parasols capable of blocking the sun for several people are often used as fixed or semi-fixed devices, used with patio tables or other outdoor furniture, or as points of shade on a sunny beach.<br/>The umbrella served in this case as a defense against rain rather than sun.<br/>In the ceremonies of Timkat (Epiphany), priests will carry a model of the Tablets of Stone, called a Tabot, on their heads in procession to a body of water, which will then be blessed.<br/>Hence, a parasol shields from sunlight while a parapluie shields from rain.<br/>In some paintings on a temple wall, a parasol is held over the figure of a god carried in procession.<br/>Another distinction can be made between manually operated umbrellas and spring-loaded automatic umbrellas, which spring open at the press of a button.<br/>It is designed to protect

aquatic organisms have a limited ability to regulate their osmotic balance and therefore can only live within a narrow range of salinity, diadromous fish have the ability to migrate between fresh

and water in its manufacture.<br/>There are multiple trails leading to the beach and a small road that leads to the only building at the beach and a small boat ramp.<br/>Despite its name, the taffy contains no salt water (seawater), but does contain both salt and water.<br/>Another cites a storm which caused ocean water to wash over the candy, which was consequently (and successfully) marketed with the appropriate name.<br/>Salt water taffy is still sold widely on the boardwalks in Atlantic City (including shops in existence since the 19th century), nearby Ocean City, and other popular

50.<br/>Biggest seas in Pacific Ocean.<br/>however, each particular basin has its own seasonal patterns.<br/>The lowest counts of less than 32 parts per thousand are found in the far north as less evaporation of seawater takes place in these frigid areas.<br/>In the 16th and 17th centuries, Spain considered the Pacific Ocean a mare clausum\u2014a sea closed to other naval powers.<br/>The Pacific Ocean is the only ocean which is mostly bounded by subduction zones.<br/>Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter.<br/>The exploitation of the Pacific's mineral wealth is hampered by the ocean's great depths.<br/><br/><br/><strong>small wave</strong><strong>: </strong>Ripples on the surface of a pond are actually a combination of transverse and longitudinal waves.<br/>A ripple on a pond is one example.<br/>Sometimes one is interested in a single specific wave.<br/>The analysis of the wave can be based upon comparison of the local wavelength with the local water depth.<br/>For example, in an ocean wave approaching shore, the incoming wave undulates with a varying local wavelength that depends in part on the depth of the sea floor compared to the wave height.<br/>The image depicts an enormous wave threatening three boats off the coast in the Sagami Bay (Kanagawa Prefecture) while Mount Fuji rises in the background.<br/>As the name of the piece indicates the boats are in Kanagawa prefecture, with Tokyo to the north, Mount Fuji to the northwest, the bay of Sagami to the south and the bay of Tokyo to the east.<br/>Apple macOS and iOS display a small version of the Great Wave as the image for the Water Wave emoji.<br/>Gaussian wave packets also are used to analyze water waves.<br/>This is the case, for example, when studying vibrations in a violin string or recorder.<br/><br/><br/><strong>salt</strong><strong>: </strong>Elsewhere, salt is extracted from the vast sedimentary deposits which have been laid down over the millennia from the evaporation of seas and lakes.<br/>Salt evaporation ponds are filled from the ocean and salt crystals can be harvested as the water dries up.<br/>A dish of salt and a dish of water are almost always present on an altar, and salt is used in a wide variety of rituals and ceremonies.<br/>Sometimes these ponds have vivid colours, as some species of algae and other micro-organisms thrive in conditions of high salinity.<br/>One of the largest salt mining operations in the world is at the Khewra Salt Mine in Pakistan.<br/>A major source of salt is seawater, which has a salinity of approximately 3.<br/>In Aztec mythology, Huixtocihuatl was a fertility goddess who presided over salt and salt water.<br/>Salt is processed from salt mines, and by the evaporation of seawater (sea salt) and mineral-rich spring water in shallow pools.<br/>as of the author's writing in 1958, sea salt was still the currency best appreciated in the interior.<br/>These are either mined directly, producing rock salt, or are extracted in solution by pumping water into the deposit.<br/><br/><br/><strong>tide</strong><strong>: </strong>The timing is relative to high water at some harbour where the tidal behaviour is similar in pattern, though it may be far away.<br/>About 98% of this dissipation is by marine tidal movement.<br/>The broadest classifications are based on substrates \u2014 rocky shore or soft bottom.<br/>Tidal energy can be extracted by two means: inserting a water turbine into a tidal current, or building ponds that release/admit water through a turbine.<br/>In addition to oceanic tides, large lakes can experience small tides and even planets can experience atmospheric tides and Earth tides.<br/>To make accurate records, tide gauges at fixed stations measure water level over time.<br/>The influence of the Moon on bodies of water was also mentioned in Ptolemy's Tetrabiblos.<br/>Also, although a water channel's center is the most useful measuring site, mariners object when current-measuring equipment obstructs waterways.<br/>Instead, the flow direction and magnitude trace an ellipse over a tidal cycle (on a polar plot) instead of along the ebb and flood lines.<br/>To calculate the actual water depth, add the charted depth to the published tide height.<br/><br/><br/><strong>a salt water beach</strong><strong>: </strong>One relates to an assistant who substituted fresh water with sea water\u2014either through laziness or accident.<br/>In the southern portion of the lake, where the vast majority of the fresh water inlets are found, the salt level can dip below what is necessary for the brine shrimp to survive.<br/>Since the Great Salt Lake is a shallow lake with gently sloping shores around all edges except on the south side, small variations in the water level greatly affect the extent of the shoreline.<br/>state of Utah, is the largest salt water lake in the Western Hemisphere, and the eighth-largest terminal lake in the world.<br/>In the two bays that receive most of the lake's fresh water inflows, Bear River Bay and Farmington Bay, the diversity of organisms is much higher.<br/>However, the fresh- and salt-water wetlands along the eastern and northern edges of the Great Salt Lake provide critical habitat for millions of migratory shorebirds and waterfowl in western North America.<br/>Solar evaporation ponds at the edges of the lake produce salts and brine (water with high salt quantity).<br/>Although it is called \"salt water\" taffy, it does not include any seawater but does contain both salt and water in its manufacture.<br/>It has been stated that this does not pose a risk to other recreational users of the lake.<br/>Populations of brine shrimp are mostly restricted to the lake's south arm.<br/><br/><br/>", "concept": "<strong>salt water beach</strong><strong>:

pectoral nipples, a pendulous penis, and a lack of sensory whiskers.<br/>Although both the New and Old World monkeys, like the apes, have forward-facing eyes, the faces of Old World and New World monkeys look very different, though again, each group shares some features such as the types of noses, cheeks and rumps.<br/>most New World monkeys have prehensile tails while Old World monkeys have non-prehensile tails or no visible tail at all.<br/>Some characteristics are shared among the groups.<br/>They are used primarily because of their relative ease of handling, their fast reproductive cycle (compared to apes) and their psychological and physical similarity to humans.<br/>In Buddhism, the monkey is an early incarnation of Buddha but may also represent trickery and ugliness.<br/>They placed emphasis on animals and often depicted monkeys in their art.<br/>Old World monkeys have trichromatic color vision like that of humans, while New World monkeys may be trichromatic, dichromatic, or\u2014as in the owl monkeys and greater galagos\u2014monochromatic.<br/>Some are arboreal (living in trees) while others live on the savanna.<br/>3 ft) long and weighing up to 36 kilograms (79 lb).<br/><br/><br/><strong>leopard</strong><strong>: </strong>It is similar in appearance to the jaguar, but has a smaller, lighter physique, and its rosettes are generally smaller, more densely packed and without central spots.<br/>Their pelage is also more gray in colour with less defined spots.<br/>The leopard's rosettes differ from those of the jaguar, which are darker and with smaller spots inside.<br/>The cheetah has small round spots without any rosettes.<br/>Juveniles have woolly fur, and appear to be dark-coloured due to the densely arranged spots.<br/>The fur of the young tends to be longer and thicker than that of adults.<br/>The snow leopard's fur is whitish to gray with black spots on head and neck, but larger rosettes on the back, flanks and bushy tail.<br/>It is muscular, with relatively short limbs and a broad head.<br/>Its muzzle is short and its forehead domed.<br/>It is an opportunistic hunter and also eats carrion.<br/><br/><br/><strong>giraffe</strong><strong>: </strong>These animals had bare ossicones and small cranial sinuses and were longer with broader skulls.<br/>The liver of the giraffe is small and compact.<br/>The animal's faeces come in the form of small pellets.<br/>Along the animal's neck is a mane made of short, erect hairs.<br/>The giraffe's pelvis, though relatively short, has an ilium that is outspread at the upper ends.<br/>The skin of a giraffe is mostly gray, or tan.<br/>Asian giraffes are hypothesised to have had more okapi-like colourations.<br/>Bohlinia closely resembled modern giraffes, having a long neck and legs and similar ossicones and dentition.<br/>The giraffe's molars have a rough surface.<br/>They have four chambered stomachs, as in all ruminants, and the first chamber has adapted to their specialized diet.<br/><br/><br/><strong>terrestrial animal</strong><strong>: </strong>Among vertebrates Amphibians have this characteristic relying on a moist environment and breathing through their moist skin.<br/>Many animals considered terrestrial have a life-cycle that is partly dependent on being in water.<br/>They are adapted to most of the habitats on Earth.<br/>There are other less common terms that apply to specific groups of terrestrial animals:.<br/>Terrestrial animals do not form a unified clade.<br/>Saxicolous creatures are rock dwelling.<br/>The shell of a snail is constructed of calcium carbonate, but even in acidic soils one can find various species of shell-less slugs.<br/>Nematodes are usually microscopic with this lifestyle.<br/>Velvet worms are prone to desiccation not due to breathing through their skin but due to their spiracles being inefficient at protecting from desiccation, like Clitellates they demonstrate extensive terrestrial adaptations and differences from their marine relatives including live birth.<br/>Many other animal groups solely have terrestrial animals that live like this: Land Planarians, Land Ribbon Worms, Nematodes, and Land Annelids breathe like this.<br/><br/><br/><strong>giraffidae</strong><strong>: </strong>They have an ambling gait similar to camels, with their weight supported alternately by their left and right legs, while their necks maintain balance.<br/>They have cloven hooves and cannon bones, much like bovids, and a complex, four-chambered stomach.<br/>Ossicones are similar to the horns of antelopes and cattle, except that they are derived from ossified cartilage or subcutaneous connective tissues rather than living bone, and that the ossicones remain covered in skin and fur, rather than horny keratin.<br/>In okapi, the male's ossicones are smaller in proportion to the head, and taper towards their tips, forming a sharper point than the comparatively blunt giraffe ossicone.<br/>Males typically have thicker ossicones that become bald on top due to frequent necking.<br/>The okapi's neck is long compared to most ruminants, but not nearly so long as the giraffe's.<br/>Ossicones are distinguished from the superficially similar structures of horns and antlers by their unique development and a permanent covering of skin and fur.<br/>They have no upper incisors or upper canines, replacing them with a tough, horny pad.<br/>however, later research has revealed these structures to be consistent with the ossicones of giraffes and okapi.<br/>Giraffids have prehensile tongues (specially adapted for grasping).<br/><br/><br/><strong>spot</strong><strong>: </strong>The male prostate is biologically homologous to the Skene's gland.<br/>One common sex toy is the specially-designed G-spot vibrator, which is a phallus-like vibrator that has a curved tip and attempts to make G-spot stimulation easy.<br/>he states that this tissue may be part of the clitoris and is not a separate erogenous zone.<br/>For some women, stimulating this area creates a more intense orgasm than clitoral stimulation.<br/>A 2014 review from Nature Reviews Urology reported that \"no single structure consistent with a distinct G-spot has been identified.<br/>Several researchers also consider the connection between the Skene's gland and the G-spot to be weak.<br/>Objective measures have failed to provide strong and consistent evidence for the existence of an anatomical site that could be related to the famed G-spot.<br/>G-spot amplification is performed by attempting to locate the G-spot and noting measurements for future reference.<br/>G-spot vibrators are made from the same materials as regular vibrators, ranging from hard plastic, rubber, silicone, jelly, or any combination of them.<br/>Supporting Spector's conclusion is a study published in 2005 which investigates the size of the clitoris \u2013 it suggests that clitoral tissue extends into the anterior wall of the vagina.<br/><br/><br/><strong>a pelt</strong><strong>: </strong>A pelt is the fur and skin of an animal.<br/>The midnight show covers sports

prey.<br/><br/><br/><strong>this animals</strong><strong>: </strong>The tiny placozoans are similar, but they do not have a permanent digestive chamber.<br/>All of these have a body divided into repeating segments, typically with paired appendages.<br/>They also have a gut that extends through the basically cylindrical body from mouth to anus.<br/>Two smaller phyla, the Onychophora and Tardigrada, are close relatives of the arthropods and share these traits.<br/>Animals in both phyla have distinct tissues, but these are not organised into organs.<br/>The most basal animals, the Porifera, Ctenophora, Cnidaria, and Placozoa, have body plans that lack bilateral symmetry.<br/>They have complex interactions with each other and their environments, forming intricate food webs.<br/>Animals have several characteristics that set them apart from other living things.<br/>for example, adult echinoderms are radially symmetric (unlike their larvae), while some parasitic worms have extremely simplified body structures.<br/>Some animals are capable of asexual reproduction, which often results in a genetic clone of the parent.<br/><br/><br/><strong>lion</strong><strong>: </strong>Its skull is very similar to that of the tiger, although the frontal region is usually more depressed and flattened, and has a slightly shorter postorbital region and broader nasal openings than those of the tiger.<br/>Males have broader heads and a prominent mane that grows downwards and backwards covering most of the head, neck, shoulders, and chest.<br/>adult male lions have a prominent mane.<br/>they were larger than normal and lacked manes, and one seemed to suffer from tooth decay.<br/>Asiatic lions usually have sparser manes than average African lions.<br/>The mane is typically brownish and tinged with yellow, rust and black hairs.<br/>They were distinguished mostly by the size and colour of their manes and of their skins.<br/>the animal's expressive movements are highly developed.<br/>The male lion's mane is the most recognisable feature of the species.<br/>It has a muscular, deep-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail.<br/><br/><br/>", "concept": "<strong>a pelt</strong><strong>: </strong><br/><br/><strong>this animals</strong><strong>: </strong><br/><br/><strong>leopard</strong><strong>:

concern, then the total radiation dose measurement at a location is generally called the background radiation, and this is usually the case where an ambient dose rate is measured for environmental purposes.<br/>An example of this is a scintillation detector used for surface contamination monitoring.<br/>this is known as \"cosmic ray induced neutron signature\", or \"ship effect\" as it was first detected with ships at sea.<br/>The same issue occurs with radiation protection instruments, where a reading from an instrument may be affected by the background radiation.<br/>Radiation exposure from radon is indirect.<br/>This background contribution, which is established as a stable value by multiple measurements, usually before and after sample measurement, is subtracted from the rate measured when the sample is being measured.<br/>Instruments used for radiation measurement include the Geiger\u2013M\u00fcller tube and the Scintillation detector.<br/>A dental x-ray delivers a dose of 5 to 10 \u00b5Sv.<br/>The immediate dose from cosmic radiation is largely from muons, neutrons, and electrons, and this dose varies in different parts of the world based largely on the

second).<br/>Cameras that capture many images in sequence are known as movie cameras or as cin\u00e9 cameras in Europe.<br/>The images were then read from the cassette and viewed on a TV monitor.<br/>The two separate images are brought together on a ground glass viewing screen.<br/>The still image camera is the main instrument in the art of photography and captured images may be

generally called the background radiation, and this is usually the case where an ambient dose rate is measured for environmental purposes.<br/>An example of this is a scintillation detector used for surface contamination monitoring.<br/>this is known as \"cosmic ray induced neutron signature\", or \"ship effect\" as it was first detected with ships at sea.<br/>The same issue occurs with radiation protection instruments, where a reading from an instrument may be affected by the background radiation.<br/>Radiation exposure from radon is indirect.<br/>This background contribution, which is established as a stable value by multiple measurements, usually before and after sample measurement, is subtracted from the rate measured when the sample is being measured.<br/>Instruments used for radiation measurement include the Geiger\u2013M\u00fcller tube and the Scintillation detector.<br/>A dental x-ray delivers a dose of 5 to 10 \u00b5Sv.<br/>The immediate dose from cosmic radiation is largely from muons, neutrons, and electrons, and this dose varies in different parts of the world based largely on the geomagnetic field and altitude.<br/>Government agencies compile radiation readings as part of environmental monitoring mandates, often making the readings available to the public and sometimes in near-real-time.<br/><br/><br/><strong>dell</strong><strong>: </strong>A

gender or wealth, was the simple sleeved tunic.<br/>Each home had a household shrine at which prayers and libations to the family's domestic deities were offered.<br/>The physical arrangement of the amphitheatre represented the order of Roman society: the emperor presiding in his opulent box.<br/>Roman fascination with gladiators is indicated by how widely they are depicted on mosaics, wall paintings, lamps, and even graffiti drawings.<br/>The practical source of an emperor's power and authority was the military.<br/>At Imperial public baths, a person of humble means could view wall paintings, mosaics, statues, and interior decoration often of high quality.<br/>Even after the collapse of the central government, some roads remained usable for more than a thousand years.<br/>Augustine is supposed to have said that bringing clowns, actors, and dancers into a house was like inviting in a gang of unclean spirits.<br/>A mosaic workshop was led by the master artist (pictor) who worked with two grades of assistants.<br/><br/><br/><strong>purpose</strong><strong>: </strong>Similarly, using present tense to describe an action as ongoing may strengthen intentions to perform the same action in the future.<br/>The strict version of this view is that these functions are social actions that have been internalized.<br/>If all of these factors tend to enhance your intention to have some drinks after work, you are more likely to do so.<br/>An evolutionary perspective of this phenomenon is that humans survived on the basis of being able to predict the internal mental states and potential future actions of others.<br/>For instance, the reason you are motivated to have a few drinks after work is mostly determined by several factors.<br/>The tightening of competition between these three groups could result in a bid for the best company and possibly increase valuations.<br/>The proposed connective chain is that desire causes intention, which causes action, which causes outcome.<br/>One method of determining developmental relations between actions and an understanding of social nuances behind actions is to assess correlations between infants\u2019 reactions to actions and the frequency with which infants produce actions.<br/>For example, the use of symbols requires the ability to understand another's action and attention on an entity in the world.<br/>The next factor is the subjective norms around you.<br/><br/><br/><strong>time</strong><strong>: </strong>However, to a stationary observer watching the spaceship fly by, the spaceship appears flattened in the direction it is traveling and the clock on board the spaceship appears to move very slowly.<br/>The most precise timekeeping device of the ancient world was the water clock, or clepsydra, one of which was found in the tomb of Egyptian pharaoh Amenhotep I.<br/>Today, the Global Positioning System in coordination with the Network Time Protocol can be used to synchronize timekeeping systems across the globe.<br/>One of the atoms used is caesium, most modern atomic clocks probe caesium with microwaves to determine the frequency of these electron vibrations.<br/>Increasingly, personal electronic devices display both calendars and clocks simultaneously.<br/>Waterclocks, and later, mechanical clocks, were used to mark the events of the abbeys and monasteries of the Middle Ages.<br/>The hourglass uses the flow of sand to measure the flow of time.<br/>A central problem with time travel to the past is the violation of causality.<br/>According to Kabbalists, \"time\" is a paradox and an illusion.<br/>Great advances in accurate time-keeping were made by Galileo Galilei and especially Christiaan Huygens with the invention of pendulum driven clocks along with the invention of the minute hand by Jost Burgi.<br/><br/><br/><strong>to tell time</strong><strong>: </strong>A design element in the set for this series was a platform directly

from the wrist.<br/>If one is left-handed and wears the watch on the right wrist, one has to remove the watch from the wrist to reset the time or to wind the watch.<br/>Customarily, watches provide the time of day, giving at least the hour and minute, and often the second.<br/>Some dress watches have a cabochon on the crown or faceted gemstones on the face, bezel, or bracelet.<br/>Mechanical watches often have luminous paint on their hands and hour marks.<br/>Some electronic watches are powered by the movement of the wearer.<br/>Braille watches have analog displays with raised bumps around the face to allow blind users to tell the time.<br/>A rarer configuration is the bullhead watch.<br/>Their digital equivalents use synthesised speech to speak the time on command.<br/>Today, most watches in the market that are inexpensive and medium priced, used mainly for timekeeping, have quartz movements.<br/><br/><br/><strong>these clocks</strong><strong>: </strong>The primary purpose

method of representing a natural number is to put down a mark for each object.<br/>An important property of the natural numbers is that they are well-ordered: every non-empty set of natural numbers has a least element.<br/>The first major advance in abstraction was the use of numerals to represent numbers.<br/>a generator set for this monoid is the set of prime numbers.<br/>With all these definitions, it is convenient to include 0 (corresponding to the empty set) as a natural number.<br/>A much later advance was the development of the idea that 0 can be considered as a number, with its own numeral.<br/>In opposition to the Naturalists, the constructivists saw a need to improve upon the logical rigor in the foundations of mathematics.<br/>One such system is ZFC with the axiom of infinity replaced by its negation.<br/>Some forms of the Peano axioms have 1 in place of 0.<br/>Even if one does not accept the axiom of infinity and therefore cannot accept that the set of all natural numbers exists, it is still possible to define any one of these sets.<br/><br/><br/><strong>clock</strong><strong>: </strong>The primary purpose of a clock is to display the time.<br/>A major

as fat, hair and skin (of which color may vary).<br/>The bones involved in shaping the face are mainly the maxilla, mandible, nasal bone and zygomatic bone.<br/>The face is a part of the body, the front of the head.<br/>The pattern of specific organs, such as the eyes, or of parts of them, is used in biometric identification to uniquely identify individuals.<br/>Allen, people adapted to respond more to faces during evolution as the natural result of being a social species.<br/>By extension, anything which is the forward or world-facing part of a system which has internal structure is considered its \"face\", like the fa\u00e7ade of a building.<br/>Cosmetic surgery can be used to alter the appearance of the facial features.<br/>This is consistent with the Gestalt theory that an

that their wheels could be used to drive an indicator on a dial on the outside of the tower, where it could be widely seen.<br/>A second type of clock face is the 24-hour analog dial, widely used in military and other organizations that use 24-hour time.<br/>Initially, the numbers were printed on small, individual plaques mounted on a brass substructure.<br/>Occasionally, markings of any sort are dispensed with, and the time is read by the angles of the hands.<br/>Most modern clocks have the numbers 1 through 12 printed at equally spaced intervals around the periphery of the face with the 12 at the top, indicating the hour, and on many models, sixty dots or lines evenly spaced in a ring around the outside of the dial, indicating minutes and seconds.<br/>These were tower clocks installed in bell towers in public places, to ensure that the bells were audible over a wide area.<br/>The time is read by observing the placement of several \"hands\", which emanate from the centre of the dial:.<br/>The clock face is so familiar that the numbers are often omitted and replaced with unlabeled graduations (marks), particularly in the case of watches.<br/>It is customary for modern advertisements to display clocks and watches set to approximately 10:10 or 1:50,.<br/>In some precision clocks, a third hand, which rotated once a minute, was added in a separate subdial.<br/><br/><br/><strong>time zone</strong><strong>: </strong>Some junctions served by several railroads had a clock for each railroad, each showing a different time.<br/>One reason to draw time zone boundaries far to the west of their ideal meridians is to allow the more efficient use of sunlight.<br/>Some British clocks from this period have two minute hands, one for the local time and one for GMT.<br/>A common practice for space exploration is to use the Earth-based time of the launch site or mission control, synchronizing the sleeping cycles of the crew and controllers.<br/>Therefore, it is not possible to calibrate the time with respect to the Sun and still respect a 24-hour sleep/wake cycle.<br/>EDT, clocks are moved back to 1:00 a.<br/>Ships may decide to adjust their clocks at a convenient time, usually at night, not exactly when they cross a certain longitude.<br/>Since the 1920s a nautical standard time system has been in operation for ships on the high seas.<br/>In 1876, his first proposal was for a global 24-hour clock, conceptually located at the centre of the Earth and not linked to any surface meridian.<br/>9, the zoneinfo module introduces timezone management without need for third party module.<br/><br/><br/><strong>quartz clock</strong><strong>: </strong>The primary purpose of a clock is to display the time.<br/>A major stimulus to improving the accuracy and reliability of clocks was the importance of precise time-keeping for navigation.<br/>As well as telling the time, these grand clocks were symbols of status, grandeur and wealth of the Urtuq State.<br/>Some of the more basic table clocks have only one time-keeping hand, with the dial between the hour markers being divided into four equal parts making the clocks readable to the nearest 15 minutes.<br/>The timekeeping element in every modern clock is a harmonic oscillator, a physical object (resonator) that vibrates or oscillates at a particular frequency.<br/>After a reset, battery change or power failure, these clocks without a backup battery or capacitor either start counting from 12:00, or stay at 12:00, often with blinking digits indicating that the time needs to be set.<br/>The timekeeping element in every modern clock is a harmonic oscillator, a physical object (resonator) that vibrates or oscillates repetitively at a precisely constant frequency.<br/>Often pushbuttons on the case allow the hour and minute counters to be incremented and decremented to set the time.<br/>Another type of analog clock is the sundial, which tracks the sun continuously, registering the time by the shadow position of its gnomon.<br/>Usually, the timekeeping circuitry has a battery as a backup source for an uninterrupted power supply to keep the clock on time, while the projection light only works when the unit is connected to an A.<br/><br/><br/><strong>white wall</strong><strong>: </strong>In November 2020, \u201cWhite Walls\u201d went viral on TikTok, being

walls is sound attentuation, as tested by ASTM E90.<br/>The purposes of walls in buildings are to support roofs, floors and ceilings.<br/>Scarfe was employed to produce a series of animations to be projected onto the wall.<br/>At the end of the concert, the wall collapsed, revealing the band.<br/>In addition, the wall may house various types of utilities such as electrical wiring or plumbing.<br/>The ground surface or water on one side of a retaining wall is typically higher than on the other side.<br/>Most installation companies use lattice (strips of wood) to cover the joints of the temporary wall with the ceiling.<br/>As the band played, a 40-foot (12 m) wall of cardboard bricks was gradually built between them and the audience.<br/>Some partition walls are made of sheet glass.<br/>Wall partitions are constructed using beads and tracking that is either hung from the ceiling or fixed into the ground.<br/><br/><br/><strong>analog watch</strong><strong>: </strong>this

Italy is Sicilian pizza (locally called sfincione or sfinciuni), a thick-crust or deep-dish pizza originating during the 17th century in Sicily: it is essentially a focaccia that is typically topped with tomato sauce and other ingredients.<br/>The most popular variety of pizza is called \"muzzarella\" (mozzarella), similar to Neapolitan pizza (bread, tomato sauce and cheese) but made with a thicker \"media masa\" crust, triple cheese and tomato sauce, usually also with olives.<br/>The outer edge of the pizza is sometimes referred to as the cornicione.<br/>\"Zanzibar pizza\" is a street

dough foods.<br/>Many cultures have dishes that are prepared by deep frying dough in many various forms.<br/>Fried dough foods.<br/>In countries in the Sahel region of Africa, dough balls called aiysh or biya are made from sorghum or millet, and are ground and boiled.<br/>these doughs are often called \"short\" by bakers.<br/>The process of making and shaping dough is a precursor to making a wide variety of foodstuffs, particularly breads and bread-based items, but also including biscuits, cakes, cookies, dumplings, flatbreads, noodles, pasta, pastry, pizza, piecrusts, and similar items.<br/>Techniques used in dough production depend on the type of dough and final product.<br/>While breads and other products made from doughs are often baked, some types of dough-based foods are cooked over direct heat, such as tortillas, which are cooked directly on a griddle.<br/>Doughnuts are a type of fried dough food that are covered separately in the Wikipedia article List of doughnut varieties.<br/><br/><br/><strong>pie</strong><strong>: </strong>The Cornish pasty is an adaptation of the pie to a working man's daily food needs.<br/>The first reference to \"pyes\" as food items appeared in England (in a Latin context) as early as the 12th century), but it is not clear that this referred to baked pies.<br/>Some of these pies are pies in name only, such as the Boston cream pie, which is a cake.<br/>Many sweet pies are served this way.<br/>The largest pies of the era were \"standing pies\", which were baked with steam holes, which were then sealed with melted butter (which would harden to seal the pie), and then eaten over several months.<br/>Early pies were in the form of flat, round or freeform crusty cakes called galettes consisting of a crust of ground oats, wheat, rye, or barley containing honey inside.<br/>Settlers' recipes were for English-style meat pies.<br/>Some pies contained cooked rabbits, frogs, crows, and pigeons.<br/>Swedish immigrants in the plains states brought recipes for fish pie and berry pie.<br/>Also called libum by the Romans, it was more like a modern-day cheesecake on a pastry base, often used as an offering to the gods.<br/><br/><br/><strong>bread</strong><strong>: </strong>Most bread eaten in the West is leavened.<br/>Nutritionally, bread is categorized as a source of grains in the food pyramid.<br/>Professional bread recipes are stated using the baker's percentage notation.<br/>Unleavened breads, such as the tortilla and roti, are staple foods in Central America and South Asia, respectively.<br/>Common table breads made from these doughs result in a finely textured, light bread.<br/>A simple technique for leavening bread is the use of gas-producing chemicals.<br/>Because air pockets within this gluten network result from carbon dioxide production during leavening, bread can be defined as a foam, or a gas-in-solid solution.<br/>Many breads are leavened by yeast.<br/>The crust of most breads is harder, and more complexly and intensely flavored, than the rest.<br/>Words for bread, including \"dough\" and \"bread\" itself, are used in English-speaking countries as synonyms for money.<br/><br/><br/><strong>brown bread</strong><strong>: </strong>This list does not include cakes, pastries, or fried dough foods, which are listed in separate Wikipedia articles.<br/>It also does not list foods in which bread is an ingredient which is processed further before serving.<br/>The brown colour of whole grain breads is caused by cerealine, a discovery attributed to Hippolyte M\u00e8ge-Mouri\u00e8s of France.<br/>In some regions of the US, the bread is simply called wheat bread in contrast to white bread.<br/>Furthermore, bread plays an essential role in both religious rituals and secular culture.<br/>This is a list of notable baked or steamed bread varieties.<br/>The new system of making bread.<br/>In England, brown bread was made from brown

franks.<br/><br/><br/><strong>cookies</strong><strong>: </strong>If cookies were used in this situation, the cookies would be the same.<br/>Other types of cookies are classified for other reasons, such as their ingredients, size, or intended time of serving:.<br/>Cookies that are baked as a solid layer on a sheet pan and then cut, rather than being baked as individual pieces, are called in British English bar cookies or traybakes.<br/>Chewier biscuits are sometimes called cookies even in the United Kingdom.<br/>These very large cookies are sold at grocery stores, restaurants and coffeeshops.<br/>In most English-speaking countries except for the United States, crunchy cookies are called biscuits.<br/>A cookie is a baked or cooked food that is typically small, flat and sweet.<br/>The container used to store cookies may be called a cookie jar.<br/>One of the most popular early cookies, which traveled especially well and became known on every continent by similar names, was the jumble, a relatively hard cookie made largely from nuts, sweetener, and water.<br/>In the UK, the term \"cookie\" often refers only to this particular type of product.<br/><br/><br/><strong>bhakri</strong><strong>: </strong>The preparation is similar to jowar bhakris.<br/>The dough is split into little balls.<br/>Bhakri (bh\u0101kri, bhakkari) is a round bread often used in the cuisine of the states of Maharashtra, Gujarat  and Goa in India, along with several regions of western and central India, including areas of Rajasthan and Malwa and Karnataka in South India.<br/>List of Indian breads.<br/>Different types of millets (jowar, bajra, nachni) are the more common grains used for making bhakris.<br/>These millet bhakris are popular in the Deccan plateau regions of India (Maharashtra and Northern Karnataka) as well as the semi-arid regions of Rajasthan.<br/>The dough is prepared by mixing jowar flour with hot water and then flattened by hand.<br/>They are prepared similar to other bhakris.<br/>They are common in the Konkan region.<br/>In the coastal Konkan and Goa regions of western India rice flour is used for making bhakri.<br/><br/><br/><strong>cake</strong><strong>: </strong>Highly decorated sponge cakes with lavish toppings are sometimes called gateau, the French word for cake.<br/>Another type of butter cake that takes its names from the proportion of ingredients used is 1-2-3-4 cake: 1 cup butter, 2 cups sugar, 3 cups flour, and 4 eggs.<br/>One egg cakes are made with one egg.<br/>They also had a cake called \"satura\", which was a flat heavy cake.<br/>The most commonly used cake ingredients include flour, sugar, eggs, butter or oil or margarine, a liquid, and a leavening agent, such as baking soda or baking powder.<br/>other cakes associated with Christmas include chocolate log and mince pies.<br/>These cakes often have a crumb topping called streusel or a light glaze drizzle.<br/>Traditional sponge cakes are leavened only with eggs.<br/>A cake is a sweet, baked form of food.<br/>Early cakes in England were also essentially bread: the most obvious differences between a \"cake\" and \"bread\" were the round, flat shape of the cakes, and the cooking method, which turned cakes over once while cooking, while bread was left upright throughout the baking process.<br/><br/><br/><strong>the food items</strong><strong>: </strong>This is a list of soul foods and dishes.<br/>Some meat soul foods and dishes include:.<br/>List of foods of the Southern United

and density.<br/>Memory foam, like other polyurethane products, can be combustible.<br/>Polyethylene terephthalate is one such polymeric material, which provides certain benefits over polyurethane, such as recyclability, lightness, and thermal insulation.<br/>Other materials, apart from polyurethane, have also been shown to exhibit the properties necessary to make memory foam.<br/>The pneumatic effect is caused by the time it takes for air to flow into the porous structure of the foam.<br/>The HAP emissions associated with polyurethane foam production include methylene chloride, toluene diisocyanate, methyl chloroform, methylene diphenyl diisocyanate, propylene oxide, diethanolamine, methyl ethyl ketone, methanol, and toluene.<br/>The United States Environmental Protection Agency published two documents proposing National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAP) concerning hazardous emissions produced during the making of flexible polyurethane foam

object is just another object to which the object is linked.<br/>Another scripting language that takes this approach is Lua.<br/>For example, objects of type Circle and Square are derived from a common class called Shape.<br/>This variable is late-bound.<br/>every object has its own copy of each one.<br/>New objects can be created based on already existing objects chosen as their prototype.<br/>In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another.<br/>It claims that everything is an object.<br/>A more complex example would be a command consisting of the length and code point of the command and values consisting of linearized objects representing the command's parameters.<br/>The idea of the fruit class doesn't exist explicitly, but as the equivalence class of the objects sharing the same prototype.<br/><br/><br/><strong>styrofoam</strong><strong>: </strong>The claimed R-value of Styrofoam insulation is five per inch.<br/>The trademarked term is used generically although it is a different material from the extruded polystyrene used for Styrofoam insulation.<br/>Styrofoam is composed of 98% air, making it lightweight and buoyant.<br/>In the United States and Canada, the colloquial use of the word styrofoam refers to another material that is usually white in color and made of expanded (not extruded) polystyrene foam (EPS).<br/>Styrofoam is a brand of insulation made from extruded polystyrene foam.<br/>Dow insulation Styrofoam has a distinctive blue color.<br/>Dow also produces Styrofoam as structural insulated panels for use by florists and in craft products.<br/>Dow produces Styrofoam building materials, including varieties of building insulation sheathing and pipe insulation.<br/>The Styrofoam brand polystyrene foam, which is used for craft applications, can be identified by its roughness and the \"crunch\" it makes when cut.<br/>Styrofoam has a variety of

smaller fingers.<br/>The somatosensory system is spread through all major parts of the vertebrate body.<br/><br/><br/><strong>fiberglass</strong><strong>: </strong>Storage tanks can be made of fiberglass with capacities up to about 300 tonnes.<br/>The component-making process involves building up a component on the fiberglass mold.<br/>A fiberglass component is typically of a thin \"shell\" construction, sometimes filled on the inside with structural foam, as in the case of surfboards.<br/>The plug can be made from a variety of materials, usually certain types of foam.<br/>One notable feature of fiberglass is that the resins used are subject to contraction during the curing process.<br/>The fiberglass used will typically be identical to that which will be used in the final product.<br/>The process of manufacturing fiberglass is called pultrusion.<br/>The mold is a negative image of the component to be made, so the fiberglass will be applied inside the mold, rather than around it.<br/>The process usually involves first making a mold and then using the mold to make the fiberglass component.<br/>The fiberglass mold process begins with an object known as the plug or buck.<br/><br/><br/><strong>surfing</strong><strong>: </strong>Most modern surfboards are made of fiberglass foam (PU), with one or more wooden strips or \"stringers\", fiberglass cloth, and polyester resin (PE).<br/>An emerging board material is epoxy resin and Expanded Polystyrene foam (EPS) which is stronger and lighter than traditional PU/PE construction.<br/>The water in the jet is sediment rich, bubble rich, and moves rapidly.<br/>The closest form of body surfing using a board is a handboard which normally has one strap over it to fit on one hand.<br/>A newer introduction is a rash vest with a thin layer of titanium to provide maximum warmth without compromising mobility.<br/>The reef is usually made of coral, and because of this, many injuries occur while surfing reef breaks.<br/>Even newer designs incorporate materials such as carbon fiber and variable-flex composites in conjunction with fiberglass and epoxy or polyester resins.<br/>The basic idea is to position the surfboard so it is just ahead of the breaking part (whitewash) of the wave.<br/>Their pae po\u02bbo (bodyboards) as well as kiko\u02bbo and alaia surfboards were made from koa.<br/>The code of

cruise line, especially attractive to grandparents sailing with their children and grandchildren.<br/>It is said that the actor originally used a purple cave boat as a theater boat, and later added sails to paint dragon scales and chrysanthemums on the hull.<br/>The older ships were designed before the current disability acts, requiring reasonable access for persons with physical disabilities, were even envisioned, let alone enacted into law.<br/>The pattern, the bow is painted red, so it is called the red boat.<br/>The Big Red Boat III, formerly Carnival Cruise Line's Festivale, was also sold for scrap.<br/>The Big Red Boat II, formerly Eugenio Costa, was put up for sale and was laid up in Freeport, Bahamas.<br/>The company earned over $20 million annually on a gross revenue of $100

soft PVC and foamed polyurethanes.<br/>In the medical field, polymer implants and other medical devices are derived at least partially from plastic.<br/>Several species of soil fungi can consume polyurethane, including two species of the Ecuadorian fungus Pestalotiopsis.<br/>They can consume polyurethane both aerobically and anaerobically (such as at the bottom of landfills).<br/>Meanwhile, 50% to 80% of debris in marine areas is plastic.<br/>If the plastic is incinerated, it increases carbon emissions.<br/>Important groups classified in this way include the acrylics, polyesters, silicones, polyurethanes, and halogenated plastics.<br/>Plastic items containing plasticizers can exhibit improved flexibility and durability.<br/>These so-called semi-crystalline plastics include polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, polyamides (nylons), polyesters and some polyurethanes.<br/><br/><br/><strong>polyurethane</strong><strong>: </strong>Degradation of polyurethane items at museums has been reported.<br/>The two components are referred to as a polyurethane system, or simply a system.<br/>Fully reacted polyurethane polymer is chemically inert.<br/>In some respects a piece of polyurethane can be regarded as one giant molecule.<br/>One of the most desirable attributes of polyurethanes is their ability to be turned into foam.<br/>The main ingredients to make a polyurethane are di- and tri-isocyanates and polyols.<br/>The crosslinking present in polyurethanes means that the polymer consists of a three-dimensional network and molecular weight is very high.<br/>Isocyanates used to make polyurethane have two or more isocyanate groups on each molecule.<br/>High-performance, flexible polyurethane elastomers are also used in this way.<br/>The properties of a polyurethane are greatly influenced by the types of isocyanates and polyols used to make it.<br/><br/><br/><strong>surfboard</strong><strong>: </strong>Modern surfboards are made of polyurethane or polystyrene foam covered with layers of fiberglass cloth, and polyester or epoxy resin.<br/>Its polyurethane foam and fiberglass design allows less drag on waves.<br/>Another method of making boards is using epoxy resin and prolapse polystyrene foam, instead of polyester resin and polyurethane foam.<br/>Finally, the board is covered in one or more layers of fiberglass cloth and resin.<br/>Surfboards have traditionally been constructed using polyurethane foam and it remains a popular choice.<br/>All surfboards made of foam and resin can face the problem of delamination.<br/>Modern surfboards are usually made of foam using one of the following construction materials:.<br/>The \"skin\", made of a gloss coated foam, is stretched and adhered while vacuumed over the  surface of the entire epoxy surfboard.<br/>Most modern surfboards are made of fiberglass foam (PU), with one or more wooden strips or \"stringers\", fiberglass cloth, and polyester resin

alphabet.<br/>Newer flat-screen televisions are \"top-heavy and have narrow bases\", which means that a small child can easily pull one over.<br/>Generally, at least one of these electrodes is transparent.<br/>in these cases, the image is projected onto a projection screen.<br/>The large receiver had a screen 24 inches wide by 30 inches high (60 by 75 cm).<br/>The scanner that produced the beam had a 50-aperture disk.<br/>Their reflected-light television system included both small and large viewing screens.<br/>The brightness of the neon lamp was varied in proportion to the brightness of each spot on the image.<br/>The slang term \"the tube\" or the \"boob tube\" derives from the bulky cathode ray tube used on most TVs until the advent of flat-screen TVs.<br/><br/><br/><strong>hearth</strong><strong>: </strong>Later, the hearth was moved to the side of the room and provided with a chimney.<br/>The numbers of hearths are generally proportional to the size of the house.<br/>This function operates in the manner of database technology.<br/>The original Hearth Money Rolls are not extant.<br/>The measure was apparently a consequence of parliamentary pressure in the previous session.<br/>The bill was subsequently amended so that the tax was paid by the occupier.<br/>The returns were lodged with the Clerk of the Peace between 1662 and

demonstrated the first 4K OLED television.<br/>The end of Trinitron marked the end of Sony's analog television sets and monitors.<br/>In 2017, Sony launched OLED televisions under the BRAVIA brand.<br/>The company discontinued the last Trinitron-based television set in the US in early 2007.<br/>It is the world's largest player in the premium TV market, a market for a television of at least 55 inches (140 centimeters) with a price higher than $2,500.<br/>In November 2007, the Sony XEL-1, the first OLED television, was released and manufactured for two years.<br/>Sony never intended to develop a home theatre version of SDDS.<br/>Sony used the LCD WEGA name for its LCD TVs until summer 2005.<br/>The first Blu-ray players became commercially available in 2006.<br/><br/><br/><strong>lg</strong><strong>: </strong>The Rolly keyboard is made of solid plastic.<br/>The TV is aimed for lower-income consumers living in conditions that would make them

77-inch sizes in 2014.<br/>In 2018, it was reported that LG was planning to sell big-screen televisions that could be rolled up and retract automatically with the push of a button come 2019.<br/>Since 2008, LG Electronics remains the world's second-largest LCD television manufacturer.<br/>In 2016, exclusively to India, Indian arm of South Korea's LG Electronics Inc started selling a TV that would repel mosquitoes.<br/>it was the second-largest LCD TV manufacturer worldwide as of 2013.<br/>Many consumer electronics were sold under the brand name GoldStar, while some other household products (not available outside South Korea) were sold under the brand name of Lucky.<br/>As of 2014, LG is using webOS with a ribbon interface with some of its smart TVs.<br/><br/><br/><strong>the

production cost of a show and a network pays a license fee to the studio for the right to air the show.<br/>The longer duration on the BBC is due to the lack of advertising breaks.<br/>The content in a television show can be produced with different methodologies such as taped variety shows emanating from a television studio stage, animation or a variety of film productions ranging from movies to series.<br/>Most television networks throughout the world are 'commercial', dependent on selling advertising time or acquiring sponsors.<br/>A standard television season in the United States runs predominantly across the fall and winter, from late September to May.<br/>The production company is often separate from the broadcaster.<br/>Most programs broadcast by Ion Television are distributed by either NBCUniversal Television Distribution, 20th Century Fox Television, or CBS Television Distribution.<br/>A scene is further divided into shots, which should be planned during pre-production.<br/>In France most television shows (whether dramas, game shows or documentaries) have a duration of 52 minutes.<br/>The first television shows were experimental, sporadic broadcasts viewable only within a very short range from the broadcast tower starting in the 1930s.<br/><br/><br/><strong>samsung</strong><strong>: </strong>The TV section shows off their big-screen TVs.<br/>The

practical route to transport ore and equipment, settling on using the San Juan River, the Sarapiqui River, and then a railway to cover the remaining distance.<br/>He also introduced the hydraulic testing of boilers, and the use of a mercury manometer to indicate the pressure.<br/>He also built a barge powered by paddle wheels and several dredgers.<br/>This is widely recognised as the first demonstration of transportation powered by steam.<br/>He also experimented with the plunger-pole pump, a type of pump\u2014with a beam engine\u2014used widely in Cornwall's tin mines, in which he reversed the plunger to change it into a water-power engine.<br/>had also concerned himself with the concept, but there is no indication that his ideas had ever come to Trevithick's attention.<br/>He worked on building and modifying steam engines to avoid the royalties due to Watt on the separate condenser patent.<br/>He was an early pioneer of steam-powered road and rail transport, and his most significant contributions were the development of the first high-pressure steam engine and the first working railway steam locomotive.<br/>William Murdoch had developed and demonstrated a model steam carriage, initially in 1784, and demonstrated it to Trevithick at his request in 1794.<br/><br/><br/><strong>blaise pascal</strong><strong>: </strong>He introduced a primitive form of roulette and the roulette wheel in his search for a perpetual motion machine.<br/>He demonstrated this principle by attaching a thin tube to a barrel full of water and filling the tube with water up to the level of the third floor of a building.<br/>He proved that hydrostatic pressure depends not on the weight of the fluid but on the elevation difference.<br/>Blaise Pascal's works: text, concordances and frequency lists.<br/>Blaise Pascal featured on the 500 French Franc banknote in 1977.<br/>Blaise Pascal at the Mathematics Genealogy Project.<br/>he wrote a significant treatise on the subject of projective geometry at the age of 16.<br/>Pascal also used De l'Esprit g\u00e9om\u00e9trique to develop a theory of definition.<br/>Scuba divers must understand this principle.<br/>Pascal continued to make improvements to his design through the next decade, and he refers to some 50 machines that were built to his design.<br/><br/><br/><strong>dean kamen</strong><strong>: </strong>He hopes the project will help improve living standards in developing countries.<br/>Kamen has a patent on his water purifier, and other patents pending.<br/>Kamen is best known for inventing the product that eventually became known as the Segway PT, an electric, self-balancing human transporter with a computer-controlled gyroscopic stabilization and control system.<br/>Dean Kamen has developed a series plug-in hybrid car using a Ford Think and a Stirling engine.<br/>He is known for his invention of the Segway and iBOT, as well as founding the non-profit organization FIRST with Woodie Flowers.<br/>In

transport involved walking, running and swimming.<br/>The invention of the steam engine, closely followed by its application in rail transport, made land transport independent of human or animal muscles.<br/>This flexibility of changes in location, direction, speed, and timings of travel is not available to other modes of transport.<br/>Although it is slow compared to other transport, modern sea transport is a highly efficient method of transporting large quantities of goods.<br/>It is possible to provide door-to-door service only by road transport.<br/>buses allow for more efficient travel at the cost of reduced flexibility.<br/>The domestication of animals introduced a new way to lay the burden of transport on more powerful creatures, allowing the hauling of heavier loads, or humans riding animals for greater speed and duration.<br/><br/><br/><strong>aarp</strong><strong>: </strong>But Rother admitted that it would be possible to design a system that would avoid these

invented techniques for teaching speech to the deaf.<br/>Bell began a series of public demonstrations and lectures to introduce the new invention to the scientific community as well as the general public.<br/>He also developed a technique of speaking in clear, modulated tones directly into his mother's forehead wherein she would hear him with reasonable clarity.<br/>Bell and his assistant Charles Sumner Tainter jointly invented a wireless telephone, named a photophone, which allowed for the transmission of both sounds and normal human conversations on a beam of light.<br/>But he had no working model to demonstrate the feasibility of these ideas.<br/>This led him and Bell to the development of practical hydrofoil watercraft.<br/>This interest in animal breeding caught the attention of scientists focused on the study of heredity and genetics in humans.<br/>Gray had reinvented the variable resistance telephone, but Bell was the first to write down the idea and the first to test it in a telephone.<br/>Baldwin studied the work of the Italian inventor Enrico Forlanini and began testing models.<br/><br/><br/><strong>railing</strong><strong>: </strong>It used cast iron for the first time as arches to cross the river Severn.<br/>There are several methods used to monitor the condition of large structures like bridges.<br/>Additionally, this method can measure specific points on a bridge that might be difficult to access.<br/>The advantage of this method is that the setup time for the equipment is faster and, unlike an accelerometer, this makes measurements possible on multiple structures in as short a time as possible.<br/>The simplest and earliest types of bridges were stepping stones.<br/>There are many different designs that each serve a particular purpose and apply to different situations.<br/>The Ashanti built bridges over streams and rivers.<br/>Others have used microsimulation to generate typical clusters of vehicles on the bridge.<br/>During the 18th century there were many innovations in the design of timber bridges by Hans Ulrich Grubenmann, Johannes Grubenmann, and others.<br/>Most bridges will employ all of these to some degree, but only a few will

policies favored automobile transport systems\u2014and to a lesser extent in Europe.<br/>Since the mid-twentieth century, cities have relied heavily on motor vehicle transportation, with major implications for their layout, environment, and aesthetics.<br/>Some cities have introduced bus rapid transit systems which include exclusive bus lanes and other methods for prioritizing bus traffic over private cars.<br/>Technologies, techniques, and laws governing these areas\u2014developed in cities\u2014have become ubiquitous in many areas.<br/>Cities also rely on long-distance transportation (truck, rail, and airplane) for economic connections with other cities and rural areas.<br/>The urban bus system, the world's most common form of public transport, uses a network of scheduled routes to move people through the city, alongside cars, on the roads.<br/>China's planned cities were constructed according to sacred principles to act as celestial microcosms.<br/>Cities rely to a lesser extent on hydrocarbon fuels such as gasoline and natural gas for transportation, heating, and cooking.<br/>Rapid transit is widely used in Europe and has increased in Latin America and Asia.<br/>More

roses are often subject to severe damage from insect, arachnid and fungal pests and diseases.<br/>Rose perfumes are made from rose oil (also called attar of roses), which is a mixture of volatile essential oils obtained by steam distilling the crushed petals of roses.<br/>Despite the presence of prickles, roses are frequently browsed by deer.<br/>In France, there is much use of rose syrup, most commonly made from an extract of rose petals.<br/>In temperate climates, cut roses are often grown in greenhouses, and in warmer countries they may also be grown under cover in order to ensure that the flowers are not damaged by weather and that pest and disease control can be carried out effectively.<br/><br/><br/><strong>table</strong><strong>: </strong>There is additionally an internal

instance, Amigurumi is a Japanese type of knitted or crocheted stuffed toy typically made with an oversized head and undersized extremities to look kawaii ('cute').<br/><br/><br/><strong>property</strong><strong>: </strong>this means children are not the property of their parents.<br/>Thus, in this usufruct system, absentee ownership is illegitimate and workers own the machines or other equipment that they work with.<br/>However, religious pluralism makes it more convenient to have religious sites owned by the religious body that runs them.<br/>secondly, that property is legitimate when it emerges in such a way as not to harm anyone.<br/>In many societies the human body is considered property of some kind or other.<br/>Only when items are relatively scarce with respect to people's desires do they become property.<br/>The distinction between \"collective property\" and \"private property\" is regarded as a confusion since different individuals often hold differing rights over a single object.<br/>Thus far or usually those are not considered property, or at least not private property, even though the party bearing right of exclusive use may transfer that right to another.<br/>Thus, saying one owns a glass of water is merely verbal shorthand for I may justly gift or trade this water to another person.<br/>For example,

initial double-step move was introduced.<br/>This point was debated in the 19th century, with some arguing that the right to make an en passant capture is a \"privilege\" that one cannot be compelled to exercise.<br/>En passant captures have often been used as a theme in chess compositions, as they \"produce striking effects in the opening and closing of lines\".<br/>Another example occurs in the French Defence after 1.<br/>If Black plays 1.<br/>The possibility of an en passant capture is relevant to the claim of a draw by threefold repetition.<br/><br/><br/><strong>air force</strong><strong>: </strong>This role for the bomber was perfected during World War II, during Allied \"Thousand Bomber Raid\" operations.<br/>These aircraft are used for search and rescue and combat search and rescue on land or sea.<br/>The CV-22 is used by the Air Force for special operations.<br/>These aircraft are used to study meteorological events such as hurricanes and typhoons.<br/>The Canadian Air Force was formed at the end of World War I, and was abolished and reorganized several times between 1918 and 1924.<br/>The reconnaissance aircraft of the USAF are used for monitoring enemy activity, originally carrying no armament.<br/>in World War II Japanese military aviation had been carried out by the Army and Navy.<br/>By the time World War II began, planes had become much safer, faster, and more reliable.<br/>These aircraft are used for the transportation of Very Important Persons (VIPs).<br/>Other prominent air force operations during the Second World War include the Allied bombing of Germany during 1942\u20131944, and the Red Air Force operations in support of strategic ground offensives on the Eastern Front.<br/><br/><br/><strong>plane</strong><strong>: </strong>The aircraft was later rented or sold to parties who later used it to smuggle drugs into the United States, and it crashed in a swamp on at least one occasion.<br/>The animated film is itself a general parody of the

Ze Plane! has at times been on display on the airshow circuit in the American Midwest, and was previously owned by the Ozarks Auto Show, Inc.<br/>The actual aircraft.<br/>The actual aircraft used in the series was a SCAN 30, a license-built version of a Grumman G-44 Widgeon seaplane, U.<br/>In 1992, Herv\u00e9 Villechaize referenced his famous catchphrase in a Dunkin' Donuts commercial for mini-size doughnuts, where he requested \"De plain! De plain! No, de cinammon! De cinnamon! No, de chocolate! De chocolate!\"The phrase is also commonly used in many other contexts, such as articles about dwarfs and aircraft.<br/>It was rented from a local charter company by a contract production company, and almost all of the footage of the plane used throughout the series and films was shot in one day and recycled over the entire run.<br/>It was manufactured by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de construction a\u00e9ronavale (SCAN) in Rochelle, France in 1951 but not initially completed with engines because of unsatisfactory results achieved previously on other SCAN Type 30 Widgeons with various engines available there.<br/>It was involved in a gear collapse accident in the 1990s and repainted deep red, so it is not as recognizable as Ze Plane of the television series when it was painted white.<br/><br/><br/><strong>aircraft</strong><strong>: </strong>The aircraft carrier dramatically changed naval warfare in World War II, because air power was becoming a significant factor in warfare.<br/>This change took place during World War II in response to air power becoming a significant factor in warfare, driven by the superior range, flexibility and effectiveness of carrier-launched aircraft.<br/>The more practical internal combustion piston engine was used for virtually all fixed-wing aircraft until World War II and is still used in many smaller aircraft.<br/>During World War II, this shape was widely adopted for tethered balloons.<br/>During World War II, these ships would become known as fleet carriers.<br/>World War II in the Pacific Ocean involved clashes between aircraft carrier fleets.<br/>Since World War II, aircraft carrier designs have increased in size to accommodate a steady increase in aircraft size.<br/>This is the largest military ship Japan has had since World War II.<br/>Rocket-powered aircraft have occasionally been experimented with, and the Messerschmitt Me 163 Komet fighter even saw action in the Second World War.<br/>for example, balloons were used for observation during the American Civil War and World War I, and military gliders were used during World War II to land

II.<br/>Following its limited use in World War I, aircraft technology continued to develop.<br/>In World War II, the Germans deployed the Me 163 Komet rocket-powered aircraft.<br/>Occasionally, even more wings have been used, with the three-winged triplane achieving some fame in WWI.<br/>Most airplanes are constructed by companies with the objective of producing them in quantity for customers.<br/>Following WWI, aircraft technology continued to develop.<br/>It was an important predecessor of his later Bl\u00e9riot XI Channel-crossing aircraft of the summer of 1909.World War I served as a testbed for the use of the airplane as a weapon.<br/>The first jet airliner, the de Havilland Comet, was introduced in 1952.<br/>Then as speeds increased more and more parts became metal until by the end of WWII all-metal aircraft were common.<br/>This flight was also certified by the FAI.<br/><br/><br/><strong>war</strong><strong>: </strong>Poison gas as a chemical weapon was principally used during World War I, and resulted in over a million estimated casualties, including more than 100,000 civilians.<br/>The statistical analysis of war was pioneered by Lewis Fry Richardson following World War I.<br/>The death toll of World War II, being over 60 million, surpasses all other war-death-tolls.<br/>Most estimates of World War II casualties indicate around 60 million people died, 40 million of whom were civilians.<br/>World War II was the most financially costly conflict in history.<br/>These are the two World Wars, followed by the Second Sino-Japanese War (which is sometimes considered part of World War II, or as overlapping).<br/>The just war theory was foundational in the creation of the United Nations and in International Law's regulations on legitimate war.<br/>Of the 60 million European military personnel who were mobilized in World War I, 8 million were killed, 7 million were permanently disabled, and 15 million were seriously injured.<br/>Marshall found, on average, 15% to 20% of American riflemen in WWII combat fired at the enemy.<br/>World War II.<br/><br/><br/><strong>world war</strong><strong>: </strong>War crimes were

international conflicts that occurred during the 20th century: World War I (1914\u20131918) and World War II (1939\u20131945).<br/>The Russian Army reportedly suffered roughly 500,000 chemical weapon casualties in World War I.<br/>The establishment of the modern state of Israel and the roots of the continuing Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict are partially found in the unstable power dynamics of the Middle East that resulted from World War I.<br/>Outline of World War I.<br/>This has become the most common perception of World War I, perpetuated by the art, cinema, poems, and stories published

precooked military Meals, Meals, Ready-to-Eat (MREs) are sometimes used by campers.<br/>Live food is commonly used as feed for a variety of species of exotic pets and zoo animals, ranging from alligators to various snakes, frogs and lizards, but also including other, non-reptile, non-amphibian carnivores and omnivores (for instance, skunks, which are omnivorous mammals, can technically be fed a limited amount of live food, though this is not a common practice).<br/>Inorganic substances such as salt, baking soda and cream of tartar are used to preserve or chemically alter an

any living animal, with a maximum diameter of at least 27 cm (11 in).<br/><br/><br/><strong>heart</strong><strong>: </strong>Animal hearts are widely consumed as food.<br/>This is traditionally performed as an open surgical procedure to replace the damaged heart valve with a tissue or metallic prosthetic valve.<br/>Pacemakers, comprising a small battery powered generator implanted under the skin and one or more leads that extend to the heart, are most commonly used to treat abnormally slow heart rhythms.<br/>They are also useful for evaluating the aorta, the major blood vessel which leaves the heart.<br/>Pig heart is stewed, poached, braised, or made into sausage.<br/>Several imaging methods can be used to assess the anatomy and function of the heart, including ultrasound (echocardiography), angiography, CT scans, MRI and PET.<br/>The ECG is a useful tool in detecting rhythm disturbances and in detecting insufficient blood supply to the heart.<br/>These devices are frequently combined with a defibrillator.<br/>Haemoglobin is only used by a few arthropods.<br/>Blood tests play an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of many cardiovascular conditions.<br/><br/><br/><strong>teeth</strong><strong>: </strong>Horse teeth can be used to estimate the animal's age.<br/>These teeth may be used for feeding but also for demonstrating aggression and showmanship.<br/>It is a minutely toothed, chitinous ribbon, typically used for scraping or cutting food before the food enters the oesophagus.<br/>The roots of teeth are covered by gums.<br/>The teeth of reptiles are replaced constantly throughout their lives.<br/>The radula is used by molluscs for feeding and is sometimes compared rather inaccurately to a tongue.<br/>However, cracking of the tooth can be used as a diagnostic tool for predicting bite force.<br/>The enamel and dentin layers of horse teeth are intertwined.<br/>Historically the European medicinal leech, another invertebrate parasite, has been used in medicine to remove blood from patients.<br/>Therefore, wolf teeth are commonly removed.<br/><br/><br/><strong>to clean eye</strong><strong>: </strong>bubbles are infamous for being sucked into filters and siphons in an aquarium.<br/>Meteor showers are better observed by naked eye than with binoculars.<br/>The visibility of astronomical objects is strongly affected by light pollution.<br/>Air dust can be seen even far away from a city by its \"light dome\".<br/>Light pollution is a significant problem for amateur astronomers but becomes less late at night when many lights are shut off.<br/>Visual perception allows a person to gain much information about their surroundings:.<br/>The twinkling of a star is an indication of the turbulence of the air.<br/>In astronomy, the naked eye may be used to observe celestial events and objects visible without equipment, such as conjunctions, passing comets, meteor showers, and the brightest asteroids, including 4 Vesta.<br/>Due to the delicate eye sacs, enthusiasts must ensure that their bubble eye is kept in aquariums free from sharp objects.<br/>Colors can be seen but this is limited by the fact that the eye uses rods instead of cones to view fainter stars.<br/><br/><br/><strong>white spoon</strong><strong>: </strong>Spoons are primarily used to transfer edibles from vessel to mouth, usually at a dining table.<br/>Horn spoons are still used for eating boiled eggs because they don't tarnish (like silver) from the sulfurous yolk.<br/>Ear spoon \u2014 a small spoon used to remove earwax, more common before the marketing of cotton-tipped swabs for this purpose.<br/>Caddy spoon \u2014 used for measuring tea leaves.<br/>Melon spoon \u2014 often silver, used for eating melon.<br/>Straw spoon\u2014the

of coconut shell that is usually used for bathing.<br/><br/><br/><strong>these sticks</strong><strong>: </strong>Thick sticks are used for special ceremonies, such as funerals.<br/>Highly scented Chinese incense sticks are used by some Buddhists.<br/>Incense clocks are used to time social, medical and religious practices in parts of eastern Asia.<br/>In the case of cored incensed sticks, several methods are employed to coat the sticks cores with incense mixture:.<br/>Incense-stick burning is an everyday practice in traditional Chinese religion.<br/>Incense is claimed to cleanse and restore energy in healing stones.<br/>There are many different types of stick used for different purposes or on different festive days.<br/>Perfume is sometimes sprayed on the coated sticks.<br/>Incense is used on special occasions like weddings or on Fridays or generally to perfume the house.<br/>In some states, such as Taiwan, Singapore, or Malaysia, where they celebrate the Ghost Festival, large, pillar-like dragon incense sticks are sometimes used.<br/><br/><br/><strong>tongue</strong><strong>: </strong>In mammals such as dogs and cats, the tongue is often used to clean the fur and body by licking.<br/>The tongue also serves as a natural means of cleaning the teeth.<br/>The tongue can be used for stimulating the clitoris and other areas of the vulva.<br/>Duck tongues are sometimes employed in Szechuan dishes, while lamb's tongue is occasionally employed in Continental and contemporary American cooking.<br/>This coating has been identified as a major factor contributing to bad breath (halitosis), which can be managed by using a tongue cleaner.<br/>Some animals have tongues that are specially adapted for catching prey.<br/>In Eastern Slavic countries, pork and beef tongues are commonly consumed, boiled and garnished with horseradish or jelled.<br/>The tongue is used for crushing food against the hard palate, during mastication and manipulation of food for softening prior to swallowing.<br/>The four intrinsic muscles act to change the shape of the tongue, and are not attached to any bone.<br/>The sublingual region underneath the front of the tongue is an ideal location for the administration of certain medications into the body.<br/><br/><br/><strong>hand</strong><strong>: </strong>Some conditions can be treated by hand surgery.<br/>The flexors allow for the actual bending of the fingers.<br/>The thumb is undoubtedly the \"master digit\" of the hand, giving value to all the other fingers.<br/>The hand is supplied with blood from two arteries, the ulnar artery and the radial artery.<br/>The web of the hand is a \"fold of skin which connects the digits\".<br/>The fist is compact and thus effective as a weapon.<br/>It also provides protection for the fingers.<br/>The hand is drained by the dorsal venous network of the hand with deoxygenated blood leaving the hand via the cephalic vein and the basilic vein.<br/>The raccoon is usually described as having \"hands\" though opposable thumbs are lacking.<br/>The ulnar nerve supplies the remaining intrinsic muscles of the hand.<br/><br/><br/><strong>finger</strong><strong>: </strong>The fingers can be surgically divided to make a more useful hand.<br/>In the 1st-century Mediterranean world, extending the finger was one of many methods used to divert the ever-present threat of the evil eye.<br/>The gesture is typically made with the hand and fingers curled and the thumb thrust between the middle and index fingers.<br/>Diabetics often use the fingers to obtain blood samples for regular blood sugar testing.<br/>The gesture is usually used to express contempt but can also be used humorously or playfully.<br/>The flexors allow for the actual bending of the fingers.<br/>Phalanges are commonly fractured.<br/>The middle finger gesture was used in ancient times as a symbol of sexual intercourse, in a manner meant to degrade, intimidate and threaten the individual receiving the gesture.<br/>while in the Satyricon, an old woman uses dust, spit and her middle finger to mark the forehead before casting a spell.<br/>The fingers are commonly affected by diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and gout.<br/><br/><br/><strong>ear</strong><strong>: </strong>Grafts from muscle fascia are ordinarily used to rebuild an intact eardrum.<br/>In insects, tympanal organs are used to hear distant sounds.<br/>The ossicles help amplify sound waves by nearly 15\u201320 times.<br/>The ears have been ornamented with jewelry for thousands of years, traditionally by piercing of the earlobe.<br/>The ossicles (malleus, incus and stapes) normally appear during the first half of fetal development.<br/>The three ossicles transmit sound from the outer ear to the inner ear.<br/>The anterior auricular arteries provide some supply to the outer rim of the ear and scalp behind it.<br/>Hearing aids work by amplifying the sound of the local environment and are best suited to conductive hearing loss.<br/>The initial medical intervention is aimed at assessing the baby's hearing and the condition of the ear canal, as well as the middle and inner ear.<br/>In ancient and modern cultures, ornaments have been placed to stretch and enlarge the earlobes, allowing for larger plugs to be slid into a large fleshy gap in the lobe.<br/><br/><br/><strong>spoon</strong><strong>: </strong>forks are used to push foods such as rice onto the spoon as well as their western usage for piercing the food.<br/>Spoons are employed for mixing certain kinds of powder into water to make a sweet or nutritious drink.<br/>In the early Muslim world, spoons were used for eating soup.<br/>Spoons are also widely used in cooking and serving.<br/>Spoons are also used in food preparation to measure, mix, stir and toss ingredients and for serving food.<br/>A spoon is similarly useful in processing jelly, sugar and syrup.<br/>Spoons are used primarily for eating liquid or semi-liquid foods, such as soup, stew or ice cream, and very small or powdery solid items which cannot be easily lifted with a fork, such as rice, sugar, cereals and green peas.<br/>In Southeast Asia, spoons are the primary utensil used for eating.<br/>Spoons can be used as a musical instrument.<br/>Early bronze spoons in China were designed with a sharp point, and may have also been used as cutlery.<br/><br/><br/><strong>eye</strong><strong>: </strong>Other pigments, such as melanin, are used to shield the photoreceptor cells from light leaking in from the sides.<br/>They used clear calcite crystals to form the lenses of their eyes.<br/>Compound eyes are very sensitive to motion.<br/>The pigment molecules used in the eye are various, but can be used to define the evolutionary distance between different groups, and can also be an aid in determining which are closely related\u2014although problems of convergence do exist.<br/>Eyes may be mounted on stalks to provide better all-round vision, by lifting them above an organism's carapace.<br/>This high energy light can be damaging to receptor cells.<br/>Depth perception can be enhanced by having eyes which are enlarged in one direction.<br/>Compound eyes are common in arthropods, annelids and some bivalved molluscs.<br/>Cone cells and rods are connected through intermediate cells in the retina to nerve fibres of the optic nerve.<br/>Some larger organisms, such as scallops, also use reflector eyes.<br/><br/><br/>", "concept": "<strong>heart</strong><strong>: </strong>heart balm is

</strong>Poor intake of various vitamins and minerals can lead to diseases that can have far-reaching effects on health.<br/>Deficiencies, excesses, and imbalances in diet can produce negative impacts on health, which may lead to various health problems such as scurvy, obesity, or osteoporosis, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases as well as psychological and behavioral problems.<br/>Rarely, food

disinfectants.<br/>The digestive complaints usually develop within half an hour of ingesting the allergen.<br/><br/><br/><strong>text</strong><strong>: </strong>Yet again the style of music is far from Refused and the first Text album.<br/>Their debut album, Text, is a mix of spoken word, music of various styles, and ambient sound effects, often producing an ethereal, avant-garde sound.<br/>The record came out on Demonbox Recordings in Sweden and on Buddyhead in America and the rest of the world.<br/>Apart from the three \"Tableau\" tracks (which are one piece, split up across the album),

tradition considers to be sacred.<br/>In 2008, a second album, Vital Signs, was released.<br/>Stylistically, they have little in common with Refused.<br/><br/><br/><strong>sprinkle</strong><strong>: </strong>Popular terminology for this confection tends to overlap, while manufacturers are more precise with their labeling.<br/>Fairy bread is commonly served at children's parties in Australia and New Zealand.<br/>Sprinkles generally require frosting, ice cream, or some other sort of sticky material in order to stick to the desired food surface.<br/>Through the production of content Sprinkle has contributed to feminist pornography and the larger social movement of feminism.<br/>Both crystal and pearl sugars are typically used for sprinkling on sweet breads, pastries, and cookies in many countries.<br/>Sprinkle's use of the erotic and explicit imagery can be said to be feminist as it presents the vulva and internal female anatomy as worthy of being the subject of art and encourages individuals to explore their sexuality.<br/>Ecosexuality also contributes to ecofeminism, which highlights how women and nature are treated similarly in a patriarchal society.<br/>A dessert called confetti cake has sprinkles mixed with the batter, where they slowly dissolve and form little colored spots, giving the appearance of confetti.<br/>The celebration of erotic imagery that is seen in Sprinkle's work can be compared to other feminist artists or art which use genital iconography to invoke questions about sexuality and anatomy such as Frida Kahlo, Georgia O'Keeffe and The Dinner Party by Judy Chicago.<br/>The post-porn movement also values the production of pornography which centres queer and gender diverse folks as well as questions the racialization and reliance on stereotypes found in the pornography industry.<br/><br/><br/><strong>sugar health conditions</strong><strong>: </strong>A concern, however, is that overconsumption of foods and beverages made more appealing with sugar substitutes may increase risk of developing diabetes.<br/>The intake of alcohol causes an initial surge in blood sugar and later tends to cause levels to fall.<br/>Blood sugar levels outside the normal range may be an indicator of a medical condition.<br/>A 2015 meta-analysis of numerous clinical studies showed that habitual consumption of sugar sweetened beverages, artificially sweetened beverages, and fruit juice increased the risk of developing diabetes, although with inconsistent results and generally low quality of evidence.<br/>Sucralose has been shown to cause insulin resistance in healthy persons, but only when consumed with carbohydrates.<br/>Other reviews concluded that use of non-nutritive sweeteners instead of sugar reduces body weight.<br/>A persistent elevation in blood glucose leads to glucose toxicity, which contributes to cell dysfunction and the pathology grouped together as complications of diabetes.<br/>Long-term hyperglycemia causes many health problems including heart disease, cancer, eye, kidney, and nerve damage.<br/>S can size) consumption of artificially sweetened beverages lead to increased risks of type 2 diabetes.<br/>Reviews and dietetic professionals have concluded that moderate use of non-nutritive sweeteners as a safe replacement for sugars can help limit energy intake and assist with managing blood glucose and weight.<br/><br/><br/><strong>obesity health conditions</strong><strong>: </strong>This has led to Nauruan reliance on processed food, high in both sugar and fat, imported from large Oceanian countries such as Australia and New Zealand.<br/>The Government of Nauru and WHO stated that the import of western food significantly reduced the existing culture of fishing and gardening, which led to mineral depletion and economical downturn of the nation.<br/>From the 1980s, Nauruans led a sedentary lifestyle with an unhealthy diet, contributing to \"the worst health conditions in the Pacific region\".<br/>BMI can be used to predict the risk of metabolic abnormalities like diabetes.<br/>The lack of physical exercise, health literacy and improper health education alongside the cultural preference for obesity have been identified as factors contributing to the high obesity rates in Nauru.<br/>Changing diet and decreasing physical activity are believed to be the two most important in causing the recent increase in the rate of obesity.<br/>In those with a BMI under 35, intra-abdominal body fat is related to negative health outcomes independent of total body fat.<br/>Visceral fat is metabolically active, with high levels a known risk factor for cardiovascular disease and diabetes type II.<br/>Obesity is a medical condition in which excess body fat has accumulated to the extent that it has an adverse effect on health.<br/>Individuals involved in heavy physical labor or sports may have high BMI values despite having little fat.<br/><br/><br/><strong>girl</strong><strong>: </strong>The practice is dangerous, however, and leads to long-term health problems for women who have undergone it.<br/>However, in these societies, child marriage and early pregnancy often combine with malnutrition and poor health care and create medical problems.<br/>A major threat to girls' health is early marriage, which often leads to early pregnancy.<br/>Such complications resulting from pregnancy and birth at young ages are a leading cause of death among teenage girls in developing countries.<br/>Female genital mutilation (FGM) practiced in many parts of the world is another leading cause of ill health for girls.<br/>In China, the one child policy was largely responsible for an unbalanced sex ratio.<br/>\" The gender imbalance in these regions is also blamed for spurring growth in the commercial sex trade.<br/>Another practice is that of selling girls in exchange of the bride price.<br/>In these cultures, the low status of women creates a bias against females.<br/>Child labor has a very negative effect on education.<br/><br/><br/><strong>health conditions</strong><strong>: </strong>Inactivity can also contribute to health issues and also a lack of sleep, excessive alcohol consumption, and neglect of oral hygiene (Moffett2013).<br/>This type of constant attention that is required by type 1 diabetes and other chronic illness can result in psychological maladjustment.<br/>Ongoing sleep deprivation has been linked to an increased risk for some chronic health problems.<br/>\" Studies have shown that high levels of stress can affect human health.<br/>Therefore, these conditions might be prevented by behavioral changes, such as quitting smoking, adopting a healthy diet, and increasing physical activity.<br/>Prolonged psychological stress may negatively impact health, and has been cited as a factor in cognitive impairment with aging, depressive illness, and expression of disease.<br/>Lifestyle choices are contributing factors to poor health in many cases.<br/>Some studies have shown that a lack of neighborhood recreational spaces including natural environment leads to lower levels of personal satisfaction and higher levels of obesity, linked to lower overall health and well-being.<br/>The financial burden can increase medication non-adherence.<br/>Some studies have shown that loneliness has detrimental health effects similar to that of smoking and obesity.<br/><br/><br/><strong>obesity</strong><strong>: </strong>The use of antibiotics among children has also been associated with obesity later in life.<br/>Total food energy consumption has been found to be related to obesity.<br/>Decreased intake of sweet drinks is also related to weight-loss.<br/>The prevalence of child obesity in today's society concerns health professionals because a number of these children develop health issues that weren't usually seen until adulthood.<br/>Certain physical and mental illnesses and the pharmaceutical substances used to treat them can increase risk of obesity.<br/>Consumption of sweetened beverages such as soft drinks, fruit drinks, and iced tea is believed to be contributing to the rising rates of obesity and to an increased risk of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes.<br/>Promotion of the Mediterranean diets among the obese may lower the risk of heart disease.<br/>Obese women are in the position to possibly put their child at risk for compromised neurodevelopmental outcomes.<br/>Increases in body fat alter the body's response to insulin, potentially leading to insulin resistance.<br/>Diet quality can be improved by reducing the consumption of energy-dense foods, such as those high in fat or sugars, and by increasing the intake of dietary fiber.<br/><br/><br/><strong>calories health conditions</strong><strong>: </strong>A lot of consumers are concerned about possible health effects of sugar substitutes and caffeine overuse.<br/>There may be a relationship between lifestyle including food consumption and lowering the risk of cancer and other chronic diseases.<br/>Overall, researchers and medical policy conclude that this healthy diet can reduce the risk of chronic disease and cancer.<br/>A diet of minimally processed foods close to nature, predominantly plants, is decisively associated with health promotion and disease prevention and is consistent with the salient components of seemingly distinct dietary approaches.<br/>Consider intake of daily multivitamin and extra vitamin D, as these have potential health benefits.<br/>Different types of dietary fat have different effects on blood levels of cholesterol.<br/>An unhealthy diet is a major risk factor for a number of chronic diseases including: high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, abnormal blood lipids, overweight/obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer.<br/>Less than 5 grams of salt per day can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.<br/>The effect of dietary cholesterol on blood cholesterol levels is controversial.<br/>Finally, limiting consumption of sugary drinks, limiting energy rich foods, including \u201cfast foods\u201d and red meat, and avoiding processed meats improves health and longevity.<br/><br/><br/><strong>calories</strong><strong>: </strong>People who live in these types of settings often have BMRs 5\u201320% higher than those in other climates.<br/>However, alterations in the structure of the material consumed can cause modifications in the amount of energy that can be derived from the food.<br/>Some diet components that provide little or no food energy, such as water, minerals, vitamins, cholesterol, and fiber, may still be necessary to health and survival for other reasons.<br/>thus direct calorimetry would give systematic overestimates of the amount of fuel that actually enters the blood through digestion.<br/>Increased mental activity has been linked with moderately increased brain energy consumption.<br/>Physical activity also significantly increases body temperature, which in turn uses more energy from respiration.<br/>Prolonged exposure to extremely warm or very cold environments increases the basal metabolic rate (BMR).<br/>Many governments require food manufacturers to label the energy content of their products, to help consumers control their energy intake.<br/>Ruminants can extract food energy from the respiration of cellulose because of bacteria in their rumens.<br/>Notwithstanding, nutrition labels on Australian food products typically recommend the average daily energy intake of 2,100 kcal (8,800 kJ).<br/><br/><br/><strong>could</strong><strong>: </strong>Some kinds of double modal phrases are not regarded as standard.<br/>Note that most of these so-called preterite forms are most often used in the subjunctive mood in the present tense.<br/>(The modification of meaning may not always correspond to simple negation, as in the case of must not.<br/>The meaning of the negated form depends on the usage of the modal.<br/>This \"future-in-the-past\" usage of would can also occur in independent sentences: I moved to Green Gables in 1930.<br/>The protasis (if-clause) of such a sentence typically contains the past tense of a verb (or the past perfect construction, in the case of past time reference), without any modal.<br/>Hence a modal may introduce a chain (technically catena) of verb forms, in which the other auxiliaries express properties such as aspect and voice, as in He must have been given a new

visualisation of metric units.<br/>However, certain aspects of design are published.<br/>Instead American instrument makers successfully developed industrial pH-meters with a wide variety of applications, such as in breweries, paper works, alum works, and water treatment systems.<br/>This meter was sold under the label of the Cole-Parmer Corporation.<br/>Ferdinand Rudolph Hassler was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society on April 17th, 1807.<br/>Probe manufacturers provide instructions for cleaning and maintaining their probe designs.<br/>Ferdinand Rudolph Hassler's use of the metre in coastal survey contributed to the introduction of the Metric Act of 1866 allowing the use of the metre in the United States, and probably also played a role in the choice of the metre as international scientific unit of length and the proposal by the European Arc Measurement (German: Europ\u00e4ische Gradmessung) to \u201cestablish a European international bureau for weights and measures\u201d.<br/><br/><br/><strong>yield</strong><strong>: </strong>Where a buildup of dislocations at a grain boundary causes a repulsive force between dislocations.<br/>However, for critical situations, tension testing is done to eliminate ambiguity.<br/>This theory gives good predictions for brittle materials.<br/>Some metals, such as mild steel, reach an upper yield point before dropping rapidly to a lower yield point.<br/>Yield, an element of the TV series The Amazing Race.<br/>Also, precise strain measurements have shown that plastic strain begins at very low stresses.<br/>The theoretical yield strength of a perfect crystal is much higher than the observed stress at the initiation of plastic flow.<br/>Yielded structures have a lower stiffness, leading to increased deflections and decreased buckling strength.<br/>This increases the yield strength of the material since now more stress must be applied to move these dislocations through a crystal lattice.<br/>While many material properties depend only on the composition of the bulk material, yield strength is extremely sensitive to the materials processing as well.<br/><br/><br/><strong>money</strong><strong>: </strong>During World War II, the Nazis forged British pounds and American dollars.<br/>This can happen intentionally, when a government issues a new currency.<br/>Currently, bank money is created as electronic money.<br/>A form of counterfeiting is the production of documents by legitimate printers in response to fraudulent instructions.<br/>Counterfeit money can cause good money to lose its value.<br/>Paper money or banknotes were first used in China during the Song dynasty.<br/>Fiat money, if physically represented in the form of currency (paper or coins), can be accidentally damaged or destroyed.<br/>In particular, Flooz and Beenz had gained momentum before the Dot-com bubble.<br/>Fiat money, like any check or note of debt, is without use value as a physical commodity.<br/>By imposing taxes, states create demand for the currency they issue.<br/><br/><br/><strong>deface</strong><strong>: </strong>For example, many state flags are formed by defacing the national flag with a coat of arms.<br/>In the United States, it is against the Flag Code to deface the national flag with advertising or with any other sigil, image, or insignia.<br/>The Australian Border Force Flag is further defaced with the words \"Australian border force\" in block letters.<br/>For example, the Australian flag is a defaced Blue Ensign.<br/>In the context of vexillology, the word \"deface\" carries no negative connotations, in contrast to general usage.<br/>An already defaced flag can be further defaced.<br/>It is common for association football supporters traveling abroad for a match to bring a national flag defaced with the name of their hometown or a similar local identifier.<br/>For example, the New Zealand flag is the British Blue Ensign defaced with a Southern Cross in the fly.<br/>Such changing ideological emblems appeared over time, among others, on the flags of Italy, Hungary, Romania, Germany (West and East.<br/>)\u2014all of which, despite their differences, claim allegiance to a common national heritage expressed in a venerated national flag\u2014it can happen that a new regime defaces that flag with its own specific emblem while keeping the basic flag design unchanged.<br/><br/><br/>", "concept": "<strong>yield</strong><strong>: </strong>lichtausbeute is related to yield<br/>sago palm is

weight in water, regardless whether it is made of wood, steel, fiberglass, or even concrete.<br/>Until the mid-19th century most boats were made of natural materials, primarily wood, although reed, bark and animal skins were also used.<br/>The oldest recovered boat in the world, the Pesse canoe, found in the Netherlands, is a dugout made from the hollowed tree trunk of a Pinus sylvestris that was constructed somewhere between 8200 and 7600 BC.<br/>Fiberglass boats are strong, and do not rust, corrode, or rot.<br/>This is a system by which a steel or iron wire framework is built in the

supported by a steel skeleton.<br/>The raw material for this process were bars of iron.<br/>The image rightward shows the area where process annealing occurs.<br/>Even those with a concrete structure employ steel for reinforcing.<br/>Thus quenched steel is extremely hard but brittle, usually too brittle for practical purposes.<br/>One such furnace was found in Samanalawewa and archaeologists were able to produce steel as the ancients did.<br/>the steel is held in this solution until the inner and outer temperatures of the part equalize.<br/>It is common for quench cracks to form when steel is water quenched, although they may not always be visible.<br/>The early modern crucible steel industry resulted from the invention of Benjamin Huntsman in the 1740s.<br/>The term carbon steel may also

better visibility than on a recumbent because their head is higher.<br/>In the West, adult-sized tricycles are used primarily for recreation, shopping, and exercise.<br/>While this may add to the weight of the tricycle and reduces the shock-absorbing qualities, it eliminates the possibility of punctures.<br/>Adults may find upright tricycles difficult to ride because of familiarity with the counter-steering required to balance a bicycle.<br/>They called it the tricycle.<br/>There are also new hybrids between a handcycle, a recumbent bike and a tricycle, these bikes make it even possible to cycle with legs despite a spinal cord injury.<br/>Many trike enthusiasts in the UK belong to the Tricycle Association, formed in 1929.<br/>Recumbent trikes are less affected by camber and, depending on track width and riding position, capable of very fast cornering.<br/>Disadvantages (compared to bicycles) include greater cost, weight, and width.<br/><br/><br/><strong>black

much less work to move than simply dragging the same weight.<br/>More specifically, the hub is actually almost as big as the wheel itself.<br/>Wire wheels are used on most bicycles and still used on many motorcycles.<br/>Additional energy is lost from the wheel-to-road interface.<br/>For example, on a bicycle wheel the rim is a large hoop attached to the outer ends of the spokes of the wheel that holds the tire and tube.<br/>While wheels are very widely used for ground transport, there are alternatives, some of which are suitable for terrain where wheels are ineffective.<br/>The coefficient of friction at the interface is usually lower.<br/>Because of the uneven structure of wood, a wheel made from a horizontal slice of a tree trunk will tend to be inferior to one made from rounded pieces of longitudinal boards.<br/>As such and because of the difficult terrain, wheeled vehicles were forbidden in old Tibet.<br/>The axle is hollow, following the wheel at very close tolerances.<br/><br/><br/><strong>bicycle wheel</strong><strong>: </strong>Smaller diameter wheels, all else being equal, have higher rolling resistance than larger wheels.<br/>It is also possible to true a wheel while it is mounted on the bike: brake pads or some other fixed point may be used as a reference mark, however this is less accurate.<br/>their lower cost is compatible with inexpensive bicycles.<br/>Conventional wheels with spokes distributed evenly across the circumference of the rim are considered more durable and forgiving to poor maintenance.<br/>Due to the fact that wheels rotate as well as translate (move in a straight line) when a bicycle moves, more force is required to accelerate a unit of mass on the wheel than on the frame.<br/>Smaller wheel sizes are also found on folding bicycles to minimise the folded size.<br/>Lateral stiffness, especially of the front wheel influences the handling of the bicycle.<br/>The mechanism is contained inside the bicycle wheel hub shell.<br/>Aerodynamic performance and low weight are beneficial for road bicycles, while for cyclo-cross strength gains importance, and for touring bicycles, strength becomes more important again.<br/>The hub flanges of modern tension-spoked bicycle wheels are always spaced wider than where the spokes attach to the rim.<br/><br/><br/><strong>mountain bike</strong><strong>: </strong>This makes maneuvering the bike much easier.<br/>Lastly, maintenance of the rider's bike is carried out more frequently for mountain biking than for utility cycling or casual commuter biking.<br/>Some riders prefer to have a larger wheel in the front than on the rear, such as on a motorcycle, to increase maneuverability.<br/>These bikes are significantly lighter than almost all other mountain bikes, ranging from 7 to 11 kilograms (15 to 24 lb).<br/>The shank of mountain bike shoes is generally more flexible than road cycling shoes.<br/>Mountain biking places higher demands on every part of the bike.<br/>Skateboard helmets are simpler and usually more affordable than other helmet types.<br/>This made riding on rough terrain easier and less physically stressful.<br/>24 inch wheels are used for dirt jumping bikes and sometimes on freeride bikes, rear wheel only, as this makes the bike more maneuverable.<br/>With the rising popularity of mountain bikes, Randolph (Randy) Ross, executive vice president of Ross Bicycles Inc.<br/><br/><br/><strong>police</strong><strong>: </strong>It is better to prevent crimes than to punish them.<br/>Bicycles are also commonly used by riot police to create makeshift barricades against protesters.<br/>it is much better to prevent even one man from being a rogue than apprehending and bringing forty to justice.<br/>In some forces, such as the New York Police Department and Philadelphia Police Department, a regular detective holds a higher rank than a regular police officer.<br/>Whether the police are effective is not measured on the number of arrests but on the deterrence of crime.<br/>As implied by the name, uniformed police wear uniforms.<br/>It became clear that the locally maintained system of volunteer constables and \"watchmen\" was ineffective, both in detecting and preventing crime.<br/>With this transformation, police command and control became more centralized.<br/>Some police forces use unmarked or minimally marked cars for traffic law enforcement, since drivers slow down at the sight of marked police vehicles and unmarked vehicles make it easier for officers to catch speeders and traffic violators.<br/>It found that aimless car patrols did little to deter crime and often went unnoticed by the public.<br/><br/><br/><strong>bicycle</strong><strong>: </strong>It is more common to see bicycles with bottle generators, dynamos, lights, fenders, racks and bells in Europe.<br/>They all experience the freedom and the natural opportunity for exercise that the bicycle easily provides.<br/>If the rider is sitting upright, the rider's body creates about 75% of the total drag of the bicycle/rider combination.<br/>Smaller diameter wheels, all else being equal, have higher rolling resistance than larger wheels.<br/>In terms of the ratio of cargo weight a bicycle can carry to total weight, it is also an efficient means of cargo transportation.<br/>Note that bicycles use much higher pressures than cars: car tires are normally in the range 30 to 40 pounds per square inch while bicycle tires are normally in the range 60 to 100 pounds per square inch.<br/>In Europe, bicycles are commonly used.<br/>In Unicode, the code point for \"bicycle\" is 0x1F6B2.<br/>A human traveling on a bicycle at low to medium speeds of around 16\u201324 km/h (10\u201315 mph) uses only

neck, shoulder, or wrist pain.<br/><br/><br/><strong>woman</strong><strong>: </strong>In mature women the breast is generally more prominent than in most other mammals.<br/>On average, women are shorter and less muscular than men.<br/>The adult female pelvis is wider than the male's, the hips are generally broader, and women have significantly less facial and other body hair.<br/>According to Schiebinger, \"Being a scientist and a wife and a mother is a burden in society that expects women more often than men to put family ahead of career.<br/>In the 1970s, many female academics, including scientists, avoided having children.<br/>Ang\u00e9la and \u00c9mile argue about the matter.<br/>World literacy is lower for females than for males.<br/>to look sexy onstage and in photos.<br/>There

line</strong><strong>: </strong>High-voltage lines are often carried on lattice-type steel towers or pylons.<br/>Overhead power lines are often equipped with a ground conductor (shield wire, static wire, or overhead earth wire).<br/>Today overhead lines are routinely operated at voltages exceeding 765,000 volts between conductors.<br/>The power lines and their surroundings must be maintained by linemen, sometimes assisted by helicopters with pressure washers or circular saws which may work three times faster.<br/>On some power lines for very high voltages in the former Soviet Union, the ground wire is used for PLC-radio systems and mounted on insulators at the pylons.<br/>Radio reception can be impaired under a power line, due both to shielding of a receiver antenna by the overhead conductors, and by partial discharge at insulators and sharp points of the conductors which creates radio noise.<br/>This categorization is mainly done for the ease of performance analysis of transmission lines, by power engineers.<br/>Such structures may be installed at intervals in power lines to limit the scale of cascading tower failures.<br/>Feeder stations at regular intervals along the overhead line supply power from the high-voltage grid.<br/>In HVDC systems typically two conductors are carried per line, but in rare cases only one pole of the system is carried on a set of towers.<br/><br/><br/><strong>overhead</strong><strong>: </strong>Long lines may be connected to the country's national grid at various points and different phases.<br/>Occasionally gaps may be present in the overhead lines, when switching from one voltage to another or to provide clearance for ships at moveable bridges, as a cheaper alternative for moveable overhead power rails.<br/>Some railways used two or three overhead lines, usually to carry three-phase current.<br/>The feeder stations are usually fed from a high-voltage electrical grid.<br/>Such considerations have driven the move towards replacing overhead power and communications lines with buried cables where possible.<br/>Trams draw their power from a single overhead wire at about 500 to 750 V.<br/>For example, the power supply can be done through a catenary wire system near a swing bridge.<br/>It is supported regularly at structures, by a pulley, link or clamp.<br/>Modern systems use current-carrying droppers,

AC.<br/>Long-distance transmission is typically done with overhead lines at voltages of 115 to 1,200 kV.<br/>Optical fibers can be included in the stranded conductors of a transmission line, in the overhead shield wires.<br/>Electricity is transmitted at high voltages (66 kV or above) to reduce the energy loss which occurs in long-distance transmission.<br/>Multiple sources and loads can be

typically done with overhead lines at voltages of 115 to 1,200 kV.<br/>Optical fibers can be included in the stranded conductors of a transmission line, in the overhead shield wires.<br/>Electricity is transmitted at high voltages (66 kV or above) to reduce the energy loss which occurs in long-distance transmission.<br/>Multiple sources and loads can be connected to the transmission system and they must be controlled to provide orderly transfer of power.<br/><br/><br/><strong>electricity</strong><strong>: </strong>Production is carried out in power stations (also called \"power plants\").<br/>Water is boiled by coal burned in a thermal power plant.<br/>Electricity is most often generated at a power plant by electromechanical generators, primarily driven by heat engines fueled by combustion or nuclear fission but also by other means such as the kinetic energy of flowing water and wind.<br/>Electric power is generally supplied to businesses and homes by the electric power industry.<br/>For large electrical demands electrical energy must be generated and transmitted continuously over conductive transmission lines.<br/>A small proportion of electric power distributed by utilities is provided by batteries.<br/>If, as is most common, this flow is carried by electrons, they will be travelling in the opposite direction.<br/>Almost all commercial electrical power on Earth is generated with a turbine, driven by wind, water, steam or burning gas.<br/>Nuclear power plants can produce a huge amount of power from a single unit.<br/>Aluminium is produced in vast quantities this way, and many portable devices are electrically powered using rechargeable cells.<br/><br/><br/><strong>carry</strong><strong>: </strong>Carry-on luggage or hand luggage, luggage

"<strong>surf</strong><strong>: </strong>Some people practice surfing as a recreational activity, while others make it the central focus of their lives.<br/>The basic idea is to position the surfboard so it is just ahead of the breaking part (whitewash) of the wave.<br/>When practicing the sport of surfing, the surfer paddles out past the wave break to wait for a wave.<br/>A small number of people make a career out of surfing by receiving corporate sponsorships and performing for photographers and videographers in far-flung destinations.<br/>The closest form of body surfing using a board is a handboard which normally has one strap over it to fit on one hand.<br/>Once the wave begins to carry the surfer forward, the surfer stands up and proceeds to ride the wave.<br/>The surfer must pop up quickly as soon as the wave starts pushing the board forward.<br/>Another prominent form of surfing is body boarding, in which a surfer rides the wave on a bodyboard, either lying on their belly, drop knee (one foot and one knee on the board), or sometimes even standing up on a body board.<br/>A newer addition to surfing is the progression of the air, whereby a surfer propels off the wave entirely up into the air and then successfully lands the board back on the wave.<br/>A surfer must know how to react and paddle quickly to match the speed of the wave to catch it.<br/><br/><br/><strong>this

continental philosophy is in what sense we can maintain the modern conception of identity, while realizing many of our prior assumptions about the world are

alpine touring skis, or telemark gear, where skiers take advantage of climbing skins and a detachable heal, to ski uphill.<br/>When the skier reaches the top of the area they want to ski down, they take off the climbing skins and make the necessary preparations to ski back down.<br/>On one leg, the skier wore a long straight non-arching ski for sliding, and on the other a shorter ski for kicking.<br/>Water ski.<br/>The result was a torsion box, which made the ski much stronger.<br/>Ski jumping skis are long and wide.<br/>This type of ski was used at least in northern Finland and Sweden until the 1930s.<br/>Earlier plank-style skis had to be thick enough not to bow downward and sink in the snow under the skier's weight.<br/><br/><br/><strong>jump</strong><strong>: </strong>,

account's existing followers.<br/>\"The 'packages' in question are magnetic lights that pose no danger.<br/>Some of these bumpers were narrated by a lifeguard who spoke through a megaphone.<br/>The show is a parody of InfoWars.<br/>The logo was the words \"Adult Swim\" in all capital letters, shown after a freeze frame of the footage.<br/>Most notably he would shout \"All kids out of the pool\".<br/>The hosts make crafts like costumes, decorations, food, and more while talking to callers.<br/>The podcast reached number two in iTunes' ranking of most downloaded podcasts.<br/><br/><br/><strong>water ski</strong><strong>: </strong>Another tool used in barefoot water skiing is the barefoot boom.<br/>The skier enters the water with their skis on or they jump in without the skis on their feet, have the skis floated to them, and put them on while in the water.<br/>Length will also vary based on the type of water skiing being performed.<br/>The goal is to go off the jump, perform one of many stunts, and successfully land back on the water.<br/>A rule of thumb for barefoot water skiing speed in miles per hour is (M/10)+18=S, where M equals the skier's weight in pounds.<br/>The skier is within earshot of the people in the boat, providing a good platform for teaching.<br/>The spotter's job is to watch the skier and inform the driver if the skier falls.<br/>The ski's configuration allows the skier to perform both surface and air tricks in quick succession.<br/>A barefoot water skier should use a wetsuit instead of a life jacket because the wetsuit covers more of the body in case of a fall at high speed.<br/>Generally the heavier the person, the bigger the skis will be.<br/><br/><br/><strong>snowboard</strong><strong>: </strong>Another method is to stand behind the first-timer and give them a shove, enough for them to put one foot forward to stop themselves from falling.<br/>The first foot forward would be the foot set up at the front of the snowboard.<br/>Most people ride boards in the 140\u2013165 centimetres (55\u201365 in) range.<br/>Another way to determine a rider's stance is to get the rider to run and slide on a tiled or wooden floor, wearing only socks, and observe which foot the person puts forward during the slide.<br/>The \"snowboards\" were made of wooden planks that were flexible and had water ski foot traps.<br/>The racer must pass around the short side of the gate.<br/>A snowboarder shopping for boots is usually looking for a good fit, flex, and looks.<br/>No part of the boot specifically attaches to the board.<br/>The rider's boot is held down by an adjustable webbing that covers most of the foot.<br/>One entrant showed up on a homemade snowboard with a formica bottom that turned out to not slide so well on the snow.<br/><br/><br/><strong>person</strong><strong>: </strong>Cameo of a man who has just lost his most valuable possession.<br/>The synchronic problem is grounded in the question

determine the amount of material removal during a specified time period under well-defined conditions.<br/>Note that the wear rate is strongly influenced by the operating conditions and the formation of tribofilms.<br/>Under nominal operation conditions, the wear rate normally changes in three different stages:.<br/>To obtain more accurate predictions of wear in industrial applications it is

from residents.<br/><br/><br/><strong>haul activity</strong><strong>: </strong>This behaviour has been shown to be used for activities such as thermoregulation, predator avoidance, moulting, nursing, and resting.<br/>Sea ice sites are more commonly used for shorter and more frequent haul-outs compared to terrestrial sites, which are commonly used to fulfill more time-consuming requirements (i.<br/>These physiological factors are correlated with both the duration and frequency of haul-outs among walruses.<br/>Haul videos are rarely negative about the products.<br/>The haul-out patterns of female Weddell seal are heavily influenced by the age of their pups.<br/>Both male and female harbour seals of all ages are consistent with time spent hauled-out.<br/>Harbour seals are likely to move haul-out sites in response to inclement weather conditions (i.<br/>There is much variation in haul-out patterns among different seal species.<br/>Hauling-out is also used as a method of thermoregulation, therefore it is influenced by various environmental factors such as wind speed, temperature, and even time of day.<br/>The posting of haul videos (or hauls) has been a growing trend, during 2007\u20132016.<br/><br/><br/><strong>haul</strong><strong>: </strong>The livery used on rented vehicles is widely recognized, primarily consisting of white and a thick horizontal orange stripe, in addition to a large state- or province-themed picture, known as SuperGraphics.<br/>Newer trailers in the U-Haul fleet have apportioned plates, registered in a variety of states.<br/>The \"One-Way\" equipment is mostly used for one-way trips, meaning pickup and drop off can be at different locations whereas the \"In-Town\" equipment is required to be picked up and dropped off at the same location and the equipment is meant to be used for a local move.<br/>The U-Boxes also serve to load customer possessions at one location that can then be shipped to another location.<br/>2 m)

livestock since they protect the contents from weather.<br/>Boat trailers are used specifically for pulling boats.<br/>This type of trailer works well for hauling large or unconventional shaped objects.<br/>A tow pin and jaw with a trailer loop are often used for large or agricultural vehicles where slack in the pivot pin allows the same movements.<br/>These types of trailers are designed for easy loading in and out of the water and are purchased based on the specific type and style of boat they will be hauling.<br/>The tow-ball is popular for lighter loads, readily allowing swivelling and articulation of a trailer.<br/>Small enclosed trailers are fully covered by four sides and a roof.<br/>This system is used to protect the car's lighting systems from potential damage if wiring in a trailer should malfunction.<br/>An important factor in towing safety is 'tongue weight', the weight with which the trailer presses down on the tow vehicle's hitch.<br/>Hitch tow trucks are mostly sized for cars and light duty trucks.<br/><br/><br/><strong>transport</strong><strong>: </strong>Private transport is only subject to the owner of the vehicle, who operates the vehicle themselves.<br/>It is possible to provide door-to-door service only by road transport.<br/>Freight transport has become focused on containerization, although bulk transport is used for large volumes of durable items.<br/>Infrastructure is the fixed installations that allow a vehicle to operate.<br/>some of these are also categorized as conveyor transport.<br/>Here, specialized equipment or smaller versions of conventional maintenance gear are used.<br/>For passenger transport, the vehicle must have a compartment, seat, or platform for the passengers.<br/>While all modes of transport are used for cargo transport, there is high differentiation between the nature of the cargo transport, in which mode is chosen.<br/>Bulk transport is common with cargo that can be handled roughly without deterioration.<br/>Two things necessary for aircraft are air flow over the wings for lift and an area for landing.<br/><br/><br/><strong>dump activity</strong><strong>: </strong>In addition to trucks, some landfills may have equipment to handle railroad containers.<br/>Both processes occur simultaneously in different parts of a landfill.<br/>Some landfill sites are also used for waste management purposes, such as temporary storage, consolidation and transfer, or for various stages of processing waste material, such as sorting, treatment, or recycling.<br/>Other commercial facilities include waste incinerators which have built-in material recovery.<br/>Typically, in the working face, the compacted waste is covered with soil or alternative materials daily.<br/>Some former locations have been converted to parkland.<br/>Before leaving the landfill boundaries, the waste collection vehicles may pass through a wheel-cleaning facility.<br/>The residual organic materials may incrementally be converted to the gas phase, and as organic matter is composted.<br/>The space that is occupied daily by the compacted waste and the cover material is called a daily cell.<br/>Gases are produced in landfills due to the anaerobic digestion by microbes.<br/><br/><br/><strong>dump</strong><strong>: </strong>Ammunition dump, military stores of ammunition.<br/>Midden, historically a dump for domestic waste.<br/>A coin that, together with the Holey dollar, was used in Australia and Prince Edward Island.<br/>There are organised pump and dump schemes run through social media platforms including Telegram and Discord.<br/>Pump and dump stock scams are prevalent in spam, accounting for about 15% of spam e-mail messages.<br/>A pump and dump scam is a type of economic bubble, with the main difference between this scheme and most other types of bubbles being that the pump and dump bubble is deliberately perpetrated by unlawful activity.<br/>A patsy who made a negligent false statement

them.<br/>Meanwhile, a screening for international buyers resulted in the sale of international rights in 52 countries.<br/>The film utilizes found-footage conventions that were mirrored in the later films of the series.<br/>The camera is motionless the entire time, leaving the audience uncertain of what happened.<br/>The ending shown in theaters during the film's worldwide release is the only one of the three to feature visual effects, and it differs from the endings previously seen at the Screamfest and Burbank screenings.<br/>Thermodynamic activity, the effective concentration of a solute for the purposes of  mass action.<br/><br/><br/><strong>transport activity</strong><strong>: </strong>Other sources of energy for primary active transport are redox energy and photon energy (light).<br/>The energy derived from the pumping of protons across a cell membrane is frequently used as the energy source in secondary active transport.<br/>Both molecules are transported in the same direction.<br/>There are two forms of active transport, primary active transport and secondary active transport.<br/>Active transport often takes place in the internal lining of the small intestine.<br/>The energy created from one ion moving down its electrochemical gradient is used to power the transport of another ion moving against its electrochemical gradient.<br/>In primary active transport, the proteins involved are pumps that normally use chemical energy in the form of ATP.<br/>The example activities presented below are just that, examples.<br/>Because energy is required in this process, it is known as 'active' transport.<br/>This integrated activity may not be planned, structured, repetitive or purposeful for the improvement of fitness, and may include activities such as walking to the local shop, cleaning, working, active transport etc.<br/><br/><br/><strong>construction</strong><strong>: </strong>Some construction projects are small renovations or repair jobs, where the owner may act as designer, paymaster and laborer for the entire project.<br/>Other major causes of fatalities in the construction industry include electrocution, transportation accidents, and trench cave-ins.<br/>Occasionally, slaves were used for construction work.<br/>Typically, a project is instigated by or with the owner of the property (who may be an individual or an organisation).<br/>Most construction in these sectors is undertaken by general contractors.<br/>Some projects may include elements that are designed for off-site construction (see also prefabrication and modular building) and are then delivered to site ready for erection, installation or assembly.<br/>Some estimates suggest that 40% of construction projects are now fast-track construction.<br/>There are many routes to the different careers within the construction industry.<br/>4 trillion worth of construction work was in progress, according to the Census Bureau, of which just over $1.<br/>Fraud is also an occasional construction issue.<br/><br/><br/><strong>tow activity</strong><strong>: </strong>These types of trailers are generally used for carrying livestock since

manufactured of flexible materials for use on whitewater.<br/>Timber rafting is used by the logging industry for the transportation of logs, by tying them together into rafts and drifting or pulling them down a river.<br/>All other products arise from (a) biradical termination events or (b) reactions of chemical species that originate from initiator fragments, denoted by I in the figure.<br/>Rafting events are important means of oceanic dispersal for non-flying animals.<br/>New types of polymers are able to be constructed with unique properties, such as temperature and pH sensitivity.<br/>Large rafts made of balsa logs and using sails for navigation were important in maritime trade on the Pacific Ocean coast of South America from pre-Columbian times until the 19th century.<br/>The Z and R group of a RAFT agent must be chosen according to a number of considerations.<br/>Such rafts consist of matted clumps of vegetation that has been swept off the dry land by a storm, tsunami, tide, earthquake or similar event.<br/>Traditional or primitive rafts were constructed of wood or reeds.<br/>This method was very common up until the middle of the 20th century but is now used only rarely.<br/><br/><br/><strong>water sport</strong><strong>: </strong>The following aquatic boardsports are those that are not towed behind a boat:.<br/>The rider uses a tow rope to help them get up in the wake.<br/>The sail is connected to the board by a flexible joint.<br/>Most present-day canoeing is done as or as a part of a sport or recreational activity.<br/>This recent development in the high-speed sailing arena has evolved most in the International Moth class of racing dinghy.<br/>These boats have a \"T\" shaped rudder and centreboard that generates sufficient lift to clear the hull from the water.<br/>A special wakeboard boat has a wakeboard tower, which places the pull point higher above water's surface which makes it easier to jump.<br/>Two teams of players use short wooden curved sticks to move a heavy puck across the pool bottom to the opponents' goal.<br/>The bodyboard is ridden predominantly lying down, (or 'prone').<br/>Wakesurfing differs from other wake sports in that the boat does not tow a rider (continuously).<br/><br/><br/><strong>white truck</strong><strong>: </strong>a plant for trailers and a third plant for coaches.<br/>Some of the smaller factories are jointly owned.<br/>In addition, a private operator uses two of the White 706 buses originally built for Yellowstone for Gettysburg National Battlefield tours.<br/>The bus driven

its Latin names, cervix or collum, although when used alone, in context, the word cervix more often refers to the uterine cervix, the neck of the uterus.<br/>Some degree of flexibility is retained even where the outside physical manifestation has been secondarily lost, as in whales and porpoises.<br/>The upper part of the anterior triangle contains the submandibular glands, which lie just below the posterior half of the mandible.<br/>In addition, the neck is highly flexible and allows the head to turn and flex in all directions.<br/>The alignment of the vertebrae defines the shape of the human neck.<br/>The structures of the human neck are anatomically grouped into four compartments.<br/>The word \"neck\" is sometimes used as a convenience to refer to the region behind the head in some snails, gastropod mollusks, even though there is no clear distinction between this area, the head area, and the rest of the body.<br/>The thyroid cartilage of the larynx forms a bulge in the

terrestrial fly.<br/>Fiddler crabs are called \"semi-terrestrial\" since they make burrows in the muddy substrate, to which they retreat during high tides.<br/>There is little reason to believe, however, that animals first began living reliably on land around this same time period.<br/>Labeling an animal species \"terrestrial\" or \"aquatic\" is often obscure and becomes a matter of judgment.<br/>A more likely hypothesis is that these early arthropods' motivation for venturing on to dry land was to mate (as modern horseshoe crabs do) or lay eggs out of the reach of predators.<br/>Arenicolous creatures live in the sand.<br/>Many animals considered terrestrial have a life-cycle that is partly dependent on being in water.<br/>Terrestrial animals do not form a unified clade.<br/><br/><br/><strong>foal</strong><strong>: </strong>In spite of rapid growth, a foal is too young to be ridden or driven.<br/>The most common age for young horses to begin training under saddle is the age of three.<br/>More specific terms are colt for a male foal and filly for a female foal, and are used until the horse is three or four.<br/>When the foal is nursing from its great (mother), it may also be called a \"suckling\".<br/>(There is no specific term for a spayed mare other than a \"spayed mare\".<br/>There is tremendous debate over the proper age to begin

analogous to the sacrifice of Jesus.<br/>The dictionary definition of pelican at Wiktionary.<br/>The self-sacrificial aspect of the pelican was reinforced by the widely read medieval bestiaries.<br/>The size of the preferred prey fish varies depending on pelican species and location.<br/>The Christian Democratic political party known as the American Solidarity Party uses the pelican as its animal symbol, alluding to its Catholic social teaching platform.<br/>The great white pelican is the national bird of Romania.<br/>Another possible derivation is the tendency of the

the outlaw's name has been given as 'Robin Wood'.<br/>The character Azeem in the 1991 movie Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves was originally called Nasir, until a crew member who had worked on Robin of Sherwood pointed out that the Nasir character was not part of the original legend and was created for the show Robin of Sherwood.<br/>The inscription on the grave reads,.<br/>The name was immediately changed to Azeem to avoid any potential copyright issues.<br/>Robin, the default name for the player's avatar in Fire Emblem Awakening.<br/>The fact that the earliest Robin Hood type place-names originated in West Yorkshire is deemed to be historically significant because, generally, place-name evidence originates from the locality where legends begin.<br/>The story of Robin's aid to the 'poor knight' that takes up much of the Gest may be an example.<br/>The Major Oak, which resides in the heart of Sherwood Forest, is popularly believed to have been used by the Merry Men as a hide-out.<br/>An especial point of interest in the \"Friar\" play is the appearance of a ribald woman who is unnamed but apparently to be identified with the bawdy Maid Marian of the May

divided into the classes of Vermes, Insecta, Pisces, Amphibia, Aves, and Mammalia.<br/><br/><br/><strong>vulture</strong><strong>: </strong>The breeding season of the turkey vulture varies according to latitude.<br/>The word buzzard is used by North Americans to refer to this bird, yet in the Old World that term refers to members of the genus Buteo.<br/>A particular characteristic of many vultures is a bald head, devoid of feathers.<br/>The flight of the turkey vulture is an example of static soaring flight, in which it flaps its wings very infrequently, and takes advantage of rising thermals to stay soaring.<br/>This bird with its crow-like aspect gave foot to the naming of the Quebrada de los Cuervos (Crows Ravine) in Uruguay, where they dwell together with the lesser yellow-headed vulture and the black vulture.<br/>A vulture is a bird of prey that scavenges on carrion.<br/>The turkey vulture received its common name from the resemblance of the adult's bald red head and its dark plumage to that of the male wild turkey, while the name \"vulture\" is derived from the Latin word vulturus, meaning \"tearer\", and is a reference to its feeding habits.<br/>The conservation status of vultures is of particular concern to humans.<br/>A group of vultures that are feeding is termed 'wake'.<br/>Nonetheless, its appearance at a location where a calf has been killed gives the incorrect impression that the turkey vulture represents a danger to calves.<br/><br/><br/><strong>wildlife</strong><strong>: </strong>The medicinal value of animal parts is based largely on superstition.<br/>These birds feed on insects on the back of cattle, which helps to keep them disease-free.<br/>Large herbivorous animals such as the hippopotamus have populations of insectivorous birds that feed off the many parasitic insects that grow on the hippo.<br/>Another example is the black drongos and the cattle egrets found in India.<br/>The loss of animals from ecological communities is also known as defaunation.<br/>Destroying the nesting habitats of these birds would cause a decrease in the cattle population because of the spread of insect-borne diseases.<br/>Do not feed the animals.<br/>In Hinduism the cow is regarded sacred.<br/>For example, eagles, hawks and their feathers have great cultural and spiritual value to Native Americans as religious objects.<br/>While the term in popular culture usually refers to animals that are untouched by human factors, most scientists agree that much wildlife is affected by human activities.<br/><br/><br/><strong>zebra finch</strong><strong>: </strong>The life expectancy of a zebra finch is highly variable because of genetic and environmental factors.<br/>the latter requires the bird to drink upside down.<br/>Some of these animals include birds, ctenophora, reptiles and amphibians, just to name a few.<br/>When a bird is singing a learned song, the HVC projects to the robust nucleus of the archistriatum (RA), which itself projects to the hypoglossal motoneurons.<br/>Additionally, for most birds in this group, the same is true of the stopping of a bout.<br/>but while a desperate bird is sometimes let in to the roosting nest during the night, the breeding nest is always guarded.<br/>Most birds in this group have longer bouts when the gap between the previous bout is longer.<br/>The diet of this finch is generally low in species diversity.<br/>The walls of the nest range in thickness from one to three centimetres (0.<br/>This is quite different from the normal polyspermy block on the outside of the egg.<br/><br/><br/><strong>head</strong><strong>: </strong>His image of the face drawn on the grid structure principle is in perfect proportion.<br/>A typical insect head is composed of eyes, antennae, and components of mouth.<br/>The arms of Devaney of Norfolk include \"three nun's heads veiled couped at the shoulders proper,\" and the bust of a queen occurs in the arms of Queenborough, Kent.<br/>Though the number of muscles making up the face is generally consistent between sculptures, the shape of the muscles varies widely based on the function, development, and expressions reflected on the faces of the subjects.<br/>In the first circle, the division is made of five sections on the diameter, each section of five eyes width.<br/>One of the ways of drawing sketches of heads\u2014as Jack Hamm advises\u2014is to develop it in six well-defined steps starting with the shape of the head in the shape of an egg.<br/>Antennae on the

heraldry.<br/><br/><br/><strong>herd</strong><strong>: </strong>The form of collective animal behavior associated with this is referred to as herding.<br/>in the case of birds, for example, the word is flocking, but flock may also be used, in certain instances, for mammals, particularly sheep or goats.<br/>It cannot be assumed, however, that the control animal is deliberately taking a leadership role.<br/>The effect of collective vigilance in social groups has been widely studied within the framework of optimal foraging theory and animal decision making.<br/>A special case of collective vigilance in groups is that of sentinels.<br/>The obvious disadvantage of foraging in groups is (scramble or direct) competition with other group members.<br/>The structure and size of herds.<br/>The term herd is generally applied to mammals, and most particularly to the grazing ungulates that classically display this behaviour.<br/>The reason why animals form herds can not always be stated easily, since the underlying mechanisms are diverse and complex.<br/>An animal taking this role is called a \"control animal\", since its behaviour will predict that of the herd as a

of curvature.<br/>A queen closer is often used for the purpose of creating a lap.<br/>The majority of brick walls are however usually between one and three bricks thick.<br/>This method of damp proofing appears as a distinctive navy blue band running around the circumference of a building.<br/>The bond is widely found in Northern France, Belgium and the Netherlands.<br/>The pattern is usually rotated by 45\u00b0 to create a completely vertical (plumb) succession of 'V' shapes.<br/>The courses of stretchers are often but not always staggered in a raking pattern.<br/>The heading course in English garden wall bond sometimes features bricks of a different colour to its surrounding stretchers.<br/>Herringbone is sometimes used as infill in timber framed buildings.<br/>Cellular bricks have depressions exceeding 20% of the volume of the brick.<br/><br/><br/><strong>ural federal university</strong><strong>: </strong>The school has rapidly expanded due to the industrialization program of the Soviet Government, which created a high demand for engineering positions.<br/>Many industrial plants were moved to the Urals due to the partial occupation of Western Russia by Nazi military forces.<br/>The first international students arrived at Ural University in the 1940s.<br/>These federal universities are the leaders of the Russian educational system.<br/>The Ural University was established in the town of Ekaterinburg in 1920 by the decree of the head of Soviet revolutionary government Vladimir Lenin.<br/>2006 \u2116 174-FZ \"About autonomous institutions\", a supervisory board was created in UrFU.<br/>The number of foreign students, postgraduates, researches and lecturers is constantly growing.<br/>The USTU was key in providing local industrial enterprises with technical and engineering staff.<br/>The contest was held on November 17, 2011, at the 7th QS Asia Pacific Professional Leaders in Education Conference and Exhibition, in Manila (Philippines), and was organized by Quacquarelli Symonds.<br/>USTU was founded in 1920.<br/><br/><br/><strong>white sign</strong><strong>: </strong>Traffic signs can be grouped into several types.<br/>Additional panels may be placed below signs to supplement their meanings.<br/>In some cases circular regulatory signs are placed on white rectangular panels together with text supplementing their meanings.<br/>For example, warning signs are typically diamond-shaped and yellow rather than triangular and white.<br/>Warning signs are diamond-shaped with a yellow background for permanent warnings, and an orange background for temporary warnings.<br/>The city permit for the original sign was received on September 19, 1940.<br/>Directional signs use a green background with white letters and arrows.<br/>Service area signs use a blue background with white letters, arrows, and symbols.<br/>A fourth colour scheme, black on yellow, is seen on temporary signs, for example marking a diversionary route avoiding a road closure.<br/>Advance directional signs appear at a certain distance from the interchange, giving information for each direction.<br/><br/><br/><strong>forest</strong><strong>: </strong>Forest plantations are generally intended for the production of timber and pulpwood.<br/>These hunting forests did not necessarily contain many, if any, trees.<br/>Emergent layer exists in the tropical rain forest and is composed of a few scattered trees that tower over the canopy.<br/>A forest is made up of many layers.<br/>The seasonality of rainfall is usually reflected in the deciduousness of the forest canopy, with most trees being leafless for several months of the year.<br/>Such definitions typically define a forest as an area growing trees above some threshold.<br/>These typically need to be close to where the children live, for practical logistics.<br/>Smaller areas of woodland in cities may be managed as urban forestry, sometimes within public parks.<br/>They occur principally in areas of transition from forested to non-forested landscapes.<br/>These forests are composed entirely, or nearly so, of coniferous species (Coniferophyta).<br/><br/><br/><strong>tow zone</strong><strong>: </strong>A trailer hitch typically bolts to the chassis of the vehicle.<br/>The tag would then be hung on that unit's peg.<br/>Front hitches are typically equipped with standard size receiver tubes to accommodate a variety of hitch mount equipment.<br/>A blue tag might show a resource is taking a dinner or lunch break.<br/>A log book is used to track times, event details, and other information about calls for service.<br/>It is commonly seen in towing applications in agriculture, industry, and the military.<br/>Front trailer hitches are mounted directly to the frame of a vehicle to ensure a reliable connection.<br/>Front trailer hitches are also used on pickup trucks and full-size SUVs for multiple purposes.<br/>Zone systems may include standby, move-up, or backfill points.<br/>The closest unit would be interpreted by the dispatcher looking at vehicle locations projected on the map.<br/><br/><br/><strong>yard</strong><strong>: </strong>these pieces are popular for patchwork and quilting.<br/>Stables for some of the mounted branch are still located at 7 Great Scotland Yard, across the street from the first headquarters.<br/>This building previously housed the Territorial Policing headquarters and is adjacent to the original New Scotland Yard (Norman Shaw North Building).<br/>Yards are also used and are the legal requirement on road signs for shorter distances in the United Kingdom, and are also frequently found in conversation between Britons much like in the United States for distance.<br/>The international prototype meter, on the other hand, was comparatively stable.<br/>The yard (known as the \"international yard\" in the United States) was legally defined to be exactly 0.<br/>The yard, subdivided into eighths, is used for the purchase of fabrics in the United States and United Kingdom and was previously used elsewhere.<br/>The US survey yard is very slightly longer.<br/>All three had been compared to the Imperial standard before the fire.<br/>A third building was added in 1940.<br/><br/><br/><strong>park</strong><strong>: </strong>Large national and sub-national parks are typically overseen by a park ranger.<br/>They are often located near urban populations, but they provide recreational facilities typical of the countryside rather than the town.<br/>A park intended to provide recreation for children may include a playground.<br/>It usually involves a low level of development, such as rustic picnic areas, benches and trails.<br/>Parks are sometimes made out of oddly shaped areas of land, much like the vacant lots that often become city neighborhood parks.<br/>The design of a park may determine who is willing to use it.<br/>Large parks may have areas for canoeing and hiking in the warmer months and, in some northern hemisphere countries, cross-country skiing and snowshoeing in colder months.<br/>A park primarily intended for adults may feature walking paths and decorative landscaping.<br/>Many parks have fields for playing sports such as baseball and football, and paved areas for games such as basketball.<br/>Private parks are owned by individuals or businesses and are used at the discretion of the owner.<br/><br/><br/><strong>street</strong><strong>: </strong>the same people would not typically be found on a road.<br/>Street signs, parking meters, bicycle stands, benches, traffic signals, and street lights are often found adjacent to streets.<br/>One way streets typically have signs reading \"ONE WAY\" and an arrow showing the direction of allowed travel.<br/>Main streets are usually broad with a relatively high level of activity.<br/>In Auckland, for example, the main shopping precinct is located around Queen Street and Karangahape Road.<br/>Sidewalks (US usage) or pavements (UK usage) are often located alongside on one or usually both sides of the street within the public land strips beyond the curbs.<br/>These are often placed for beautification but are increasingly being used to control stormwater.<br/>They may be behind the sidewalk, or between the sidewalk and the curb.<br/>The bicycle lane may be placed between the travel lanes and the parking lanes, between the parking lanes and the curb, or for increased safety for cyclists, between curb and sidewalk.<br/>Some streets, particularly in business areas, may have parking meters into which coins must be paid to allow parking in the adjacent space for a limited time.<br/><br/><br/><strong>locate</strong><strong>: </strong>locate command is also included in MacOS.<br/>Their primary database is world-readable, so the index is built as an unprivileged user.<br/>locate was first created in 1982.<br/>It operates significantly faster than find, but requires regular updating of the database.<br/>mlocate (Merging Locate) and the earlier slocate (Secure Locate) use a restricted-access database, only showing filenames accessible to the user.<br/>Locate (Unix), Linux command to find files.<br/>It searches through a prebuilt database of files generated by the updatedb command or by a daemon and compressed using incremental encoding.<br/>The BSD and GNU Findutils versions derive from the original implementation.<br/>Places in Italy.<br/>This sacrifices overall efficiency (because of the regular interrogation of filesystems even when no user needs information) and absolute accuracy (since the database does not update in real time) for significant speed improvements, particularly on very large filesystems.<br/><br/><br/><strong>would</strong><strong>: </strong>However the main auxiliary (which is usually the first modal verb in the sentence), doesn't have to be in the infinitive.<br/>The above negative forms are not usually used in the sense of a factual conclusion.<br/>The double modal may sometimes be in the future tense, as in \"I will ought to go,\" where will is the main verb and ought to is also an auxiliary but an infinitive.<br/>This verb generally appears as a bare infinitive, although in some definitions a modal verb can also govern the to-infinitive (as in the case of ought).<br/>The electronics assembly shall be able to operate within a normal temperature range.<br/>The protasis (if-clause) of such a sentence typically contains the past tense of a verb (or the past perfect construction, in the case of past time reference), without any modal.<br/>This \"future-in-the-past\" usage of would can also occur in independent sentences: I moved to Green Gables in 1930.<br/>Modals can appear in tag questions and other elliptical sentences without the governed verb being expressed:.<br/>Shall is sometimes used in questions (in the first person) to ask for advice or confirmation of a suggestion: Shall I read now?.<br/>I would live there for the next ten years.<br/><br/><br/><strong>sign</strong><strong>: </strong>Traffic sign: a sign that instructs drivers.<br/>The at sign, @, is normally read aloud as \"at\".<br/>Commercial signage, including flashing signs, such as on a retail store, factory, or theatre.<br/>The sign does not function as its own goal, but its purpose lies in its role as a signification (res significans, DDC 3.9.<br/>This notation can be used to give aliases to patterns, making them more readable.<br/>The symbol was added in 2004 for use with email addresses, the only official change to Morse code since World War I.<br/>Naming the symbol after animals is also common.<br/>In Finnish, it was originally called taksamerkki (\"fee sign\") or yksikk\u00f6hinnan merkki (\"unit price sign\"), but these names are long obsolete and now rarely understood.<br/>The word sign has a variety of meanings in English, including:.<br/>It has rarely been used in financial ledgers, and is not used in standard typography.<br/><br/><br/><strong>this sign</strong><strong>: </strong>The at sign, @, is normally read aloud as \"at\".<br/>In Unix-like systems the $ is often part of the command prompt, depending on the user's shell and environment settings.<br/>In common usage, the sign appears to the left of the amount specified, e.<br/>In French-speaking Canada, the dollar symbol usually appears after the number (5$).<br/>This notation can be used to give aliases to patterns, making them more readable.<br/>A dollar sign with two vertical lines could have started off as a monogram of \"USA\" used on money bags issued by the United States Mint.<br/>Pound sign.<br/>Won sign.<br/>The symbol was added in 2004 for use with email addresses, the only official change to Morse code since World War I.<br/>Naming the symbol after animals is also common.<br/><br/><br/><strong>motor vehicle</strong><strong>: </strong>They include tractor vehicles designed for towing semi-trailers.<br/>This limit depends on national and professional definitions, and it varies between 3.5 and 7 tons.<br/>Those same groups have held the top 5 positions since 2007.<br/>For legal purpose, motor vehicles are often identified within a number of vehicle classes including cars, buses, motorcycles, off-road vehicles, light trucks and regular trucks.<br/>The United States has the second largest fleet of motor vehicles in the world after China.<br/>However, actual use of ethanol fuel is significantly limited due to the lack of E85 refueling infrastructure.<br/>In the US a motor vehicle is specifically defined as a contrivance used for commercial purposes.<br/>Other sources might provide other definitions, for instance in the year 1977, ISO 3833:1977 provide other definitions.<br/>The fleet went from 19.<br/>In 2016, the motor vehicle fleet consisted of 165.<br/><br/><br/><strong>home door</strong><strong>: </strong>They are most commonly used in closets to provide access one side of the closet at a time.<br/>The panels typically fit into grooves in the other pieces, and help to keep the door rigid.<br/>Examples might be found on the ceremonial door of a cathedral or in a large vehicle door in a garage or hangar.<br/>Up-and-over or overhead doors are often used in garages.<br/>The frame typically requires a weather strip at floor level and where the doors meet to prevent water ingress.<br/>A switch is operated manually, perhaps after security checks.<br/>These doors or gates were hung in two leaves, each about 2.<br/>These doors are generally red or brown in color and bear a resemblance to the more formal doors found in other British Colonies' public houses.<br/>This type of door is used in tight spaces where privacy is also required.<br/>A French door traditionally has a moulded panel at the bottom of the door.<br/><br/><br/><strong>outside</strong><strong>: </strong>Harp then leaves the base.<br/>The film was released by Netflix on January 15, 2021, and received mixed reviews from critics.<br/>The film was the most-watched on the platform over its debut weekend.<br/>Filming began around Budapest in August 2019, lasting eight weeks.<br/>The film was announced in June 2019, with Anthony Mackie set to star and produce, and Mikael H\u00e5fstr\u00f6m to direct.<br/>During an operation, a team of United States Marines and \"Gumps\" (robotic soldiers) are ambushed.<br/>Leo tortures the insurgent for information, before leaving him to be killed by the gathered mob.<br/>Harp escapes as the silo is destroyed by a drone strike before the missile can launch.<br/>Outside Studios, a British recording studio, based in England.<br/>He knocks out Harp and leaves him on the side of the road where he is picked up by Sofiya's men.<br/><br/><br/><strong>school</strong><strong>: </strong>These schools are located in forests outside of the towns and villages, and the space used is solely for these schools.<br/>An optimum school will meet the minimum conditions and will have:.<br/>It said the floor area should be 350 m2 + 4.<br/>The building (or school campus) needs to accommodate:.<br/>military personnel usually had at least a primary education.<br/>Office where the administrative work of the school is done.<br/>The number of rooms required can be determined from the predicted roll of the school and the area needed.<br/>Online classes are taught the same as physically being in class with the same curriculum.<br/>Many private schools are affiliated with a particular religion.<br/>Their training is focused on how to be a proper woman by societal standards.<br/><br/><br/><strong>tree</strong><strong>: </strong>Trees are often planted in town environments where they are known as street trees or amenity trees.<br/>A tree typically has many secondary branches supported clear of the ground by the trunk.<br/>Similar woodland is found on mountains where the altitude causes the average temperature to be lower thus reducing the length of the growing season.<br/>Thus mangrove swamps tend to extend seawards in suitable locations.<br/>This trunk typically contains woody tissue for strength, and vascular tissue to carry materials from one part of the tree to another.<br/>Wood smoke can be used to preserve food.<br/>Wood has traditionally been used for fuel, especially in rural areas.<br/>Many older trees may become hollow but may still stand upright for many years.<br/>They are particularly prevalent in tropical rainforests where the soil is poor and the roots are close to the surface.<br/>The bark is inelastic.<br/><br/><br/>", "concept": "<strong>outside</strong><strong>: </strong>death door is related to outside<br/>a soccer field is at outside<br/>a plant is at outside<br/>a courtyard

extensively to detect and target endothermic prey such as rodents and birds, and it was previously assumed that the organ evolved specifically for that purpose.<br/>Certain animals, including bats and cetaceans, have the ability to determine orientation to other objects through interpretation of reflected sound (like sonar).<br/>For example, some animals are able to detect electrical fields and magnetic fields, air moisture.<br/>Fish like the weather fish and other loaches are also known to respond to low pressure areas but they lack a swim bladder.<br/>A dolphin can detect electric fields in water using electroreceptors in vibrissal crypts arrayed in pairs on its snout and which evolved from whisker motion sensors.<br/>Some cephalopods can distinguish the polarization of light.<br/>The organ is vestigial in humans, because associated neurons have not been found that give any sensory input in humans.<br/>Many animals (salamanders, reptiles, mammals) have a vomeronasal organ that is connected with the mouth cavity.<br/>Cephalopods have the ability to change color using chromatophores in their skin.<br/>Several species of fish, sharks, and rays have the capacity to sense changes

two clutches are usually laid, and up to seven a year may be laid in the tropics or four a year in temperate latitudes.<br/>It roosts communally and while breeding nests are usually grouped together in clumps.<br/>When fewer clutches are laid in a year, especially at higher latitudes, the number of eggs per clutch is greater.<br/>Other males usually do not copulate with the female.<br/>Males may sometimes have multiple mates, and bigamy is mostly limited by aggression between females.<br/>Birds of a pair copulate frequently until the female is laying eggs, and the male mounts the female repeatedly each time a pair mates.<br/>Eggs laid later in a clutch are larger, as are those laid by larger females, and egg size is hereditary.<br/>Lost mates of both sexes can be replaced quickly during the breeding season.<br/>House sparrows can breed in the breeding season immediately following their hatching, and sometimes attempt to do so.<br/>Central Asian house sparrows, which migrate and have only one clutch a year, average 6.<br/><br/><br/><strong>bird</strong><strong>: </strong>Some species may use more than one system depending on the circumstances.<br/>Bird eggs are usually laid in a nest.<br/>A more likely explanation is that the egg develops a shell while passing through the oviduct over a period of about a day, so that if two eggs were to develop at the same time, there would be a risk to survival.<br/>A small number of species, such as ducks and geese, lose all of their flight feathers at once, temporarily becoming flightless.<br/>Also terrestrial birds generally have a single ovary, as does the platypus, an egg-laying mammal.<br/>some species can operate the two sides of the syrinx independently, allowing the simultaneous production of two different songs.<br/>Many birds actively defend a territory from others of the same species during the breeding season.<br/>They are usually laid in a nest and incubated by the parents.<br/>Some other species, such as ducks, move their chicks away from the nest at an early age.<br/>Many birds rest on one leg, while some may pull up their legs into their feathers, especially in cold weather.<br/><br/><br/><strong>this animal</strong><strong>: </strong>Some animals are capable of asexual reproduction, which often results in a genetic clone of the parent.<br/>Other animals may have very specific feeding behaviours, such as hawksbill sea turtles primarily eating sponges.<br/>They typically feed by drawing in water through pores.<br/>Some consumers use multiple methods.<br/>The apparent suddenness of the event may however be an artefact of the fossil record, rather than showing that all these animals appeared simultaneously.<br/>Nearly all animals make use of some form of sexual reproduction.<br/>All animals are motile (able to spontaneously move their bodies) during at least part of their life cycle, but some animals, such as sponges, corals, mussels, and barnacles, later become sessile.<br/>Several animals are microscopic.<br/>With very few exceptions, animals respire aerobically.<br/>He often wakes up in strange places, and subsequently, hears about animal

relational database management system, such relationships are usually implemented by means of an associative table (also known as join table, junction table or cross-reference table), say, AB with two one-to-many relationships A -> AB and B -> AB.<br/>In systems analysis, a many-to-many relationship is a type of cardinality that refers to the relationship between two entities A and B in which A may contain a parent instance for which there are many children in B and vice versa.<br/>A quantifier that can be used with count nouns - often preceded by \"as\" or \"too\" or \"so\" or \"that\".<br/>For

male and female kiwi tend to live their entire lives as a monogamous couple.<br/>With no constraints on weight due to flight requirements, brown kiwi females carry and lay a single egg that may weigh as much as 450 g (16 oz).<br/>Young kiwi chicks are vulnerable to stoat predation until they reach about 1\u20131.<br/>The kiwi lays one of the largest eggs in proportion to its size of any bird in the world, so even though the kiwi is about the size of a domestic chicken, it is able to lay eggs that are about six times the size of a chicken's egg.<br/>Two to three days before the egg is laid there is little space left inside the female for her stomach and she is forced to fast.<br/>During the mating season, June to March, the pair call to each other at night, and meet in the nesting burrow every three days.<br/>The kiwi's egg is one of the largest in proportion to body size (up to 20% of the female's weight) of any species of bird in the world.<br/>The male incubates the egg,

at around 100 km/h (54 kn.<br/>The aircraft is permitted to accelerate to rotation speed (often referred to as Vr).<br/>Vertical takeoff.<br/>In most such aircraft, any engine failure results in a rejected takeoff as a matter of course, since even overrunning the end of the runway is preferable to lifting off with insufficient power to maintain flight.<br/>above V1 the pilot continues the takeoff and returns for landing.<br/>For a given aircraft, the takeoff speed is usually dependent on the aircraft weight.<br/>Some aircraft are specifically designed for short takeoff and landing (STOL), which they achieve by becoming airborne at very low speeds.<br/>In a single-engine or light twin-engine aircraft, the pilot calculates the length of runway required to take off and clear any obstacles, to ensure sufficient runway to use for takeoff.<br/>For most aircraft, attempting a takeoff without a pitch-up would require cruise speeds while still on the runway.<br/>Large transport category (airliner) aircraft may use a reduced power for takeoff, where less than full power is applied in order to prolong engine life, reduce maintenance costs and reduce noise

wicker products are highly sought after by collectors.<br/>The largest basket vase in the world is located in Germany.<br/>Natural wicker requires maintenance to keep it in good shape.<br/>The synthetic wickers are often preferred for outdoor use (\"all-weather wicker\").<br/><br/><br/><strong>the baskets</strong><strong>: </strong>While most baskets are made from plant materials, other materials such as horsehair, baleen, or metal wire can be used.<br/>Some baskets are fitted with a lid, while others are left open on top.<br/>Some baskets are ceremonial, that is religious, in nature.<br/>A basket is a container that is traditionally constructed from stiff fibers and can be made from a range of materials, including wood splints, runners, and cane.<br/>Baskets are generally woven by hand.<br/>Baskets made with interwoven techniques were common at 3000 BCE.<br/>Weaving strips of bark or other plant material to support the bark containers would be the next step, followed by entirely woven baskets.<br/>The practice of basket making has evolved into an art.<br/>Prior to the invention of woven baskets, people used tree bark to make simple containers.<br/>The last innovation appears to be baskets so tightly woven that they could hold water.<br/><br/><br/><strong>rattan</strong><strong>: </strong>The rattan shafts of war spears are usually elaborately ornamented with carvings and metal inlays.<br/>Uses include rattan baskets, plant containers, and other decorative works.<br/>Heavier canes, also of rattan, are used for judicial corporal punishments in Aceh, Brunei, Malaysia, and Singapore.<br/>The process takes small pieces of rattan and places it in a furnace.<br/>In contrast, reeds made from bamboo contain nodes that inhibit the passage of essential oils.<br/>Fire-hardened rattan were commonly used as the shafts of Philippine spears collectively known as sibat.<br/>Generally, raw rattan is processed into several products to be used as materials in furniture making.<br/>The remaining \"core\" of the rattan can be used for various purposes in furniture making.<br/>Many rattans have spines which act as hooks to aid climbing over other plants, and to deter herbivores.<br/>Due to its durability and resistance to splintering, sections of rattan can be used as canes, crooks for high-end umbrellas, or staves for martial arts.<br/><br/><br/><strong>basket</strong><strong>: </strong>The \"basket\" is usually either made of plastic and lined with paper, or is simply a disposable paperboard box or tray.<br/>While most

</strong>The smell of the freshly cut grass is produced mainly by cis-3-Hexenal.<br/>The leaf blades of many grasses are hardened with silica phytoliths, which discourage grazing animals.<br/>some, such as sword grass, are sharp enough to cut human skin.<br/>Some members of the Poaceae are used as building materials (bamboo, thatch, and straw).<br/>The C4 grasses have a photosynthetic pathway, linked to specialized Kranz leaf anatomy, which allows for increased water use efficiency, rendering them better adapted to hot, arid environments.<br/>The fruit of grasses is a caryopsis, in which the seed coat is fused to the fruit wall.<br/>The stems of grasses, called culms, are usually cylindrical (more rarely flattened, but not 3-angled) and are hollow, plugged at the nodes, where the leaves are attached.<br/>An entire industry revolves around the development and marketing of grass varieties for golf courses.<br/>Some common aphorisms involve grass.<br/>Such grasses may be cut and

lance, were made of bamboo.<br/>the walls are split and woven bamboo, and bamboo slats and poles may be used as its support.<br/>Traditional Vietnamese villages are surrounded by thick bamboo hedges (l\u0169y tre).<br/>Floating houses use whole bamboo stalks tied together in a big bunch to support the house floating in the water.<br/>Many Buddhist temples also have bamboo groves.<br/>Many ethnic groups in remote areas that have water access in Asia use bamboo that is 3\u20135 years old to make rafts.<br/>The usual process by which textiles labeled as being made of bamboo are produced uses

bear</strong><strong>: </strong>is an American retailer headquartered in Overland, Missouri that sells teddy bears and other stuffed animals and characters.<br/>Following World War II, manufacturers began to adopt more synthetic materials into production, and in 1954, the first teddy bear made from easily washable materials was produced.<br/>At the same time in the US, Morris Michtom created the first teddy bear after being inspired by a drawing of President \"Teddy\" Roosevelt with a bear cub.<br/>Many people also handmade their own stuffed toys.<br/>These preferences include being able to choose from numerous different stuffed animals, along with varying scents, sounds, and outfits.<br/>Customers go through an interactive process in which the stuffed animal of their choice is assembled and tailored to their own preferences during their visit to the store.<br/>The stuffed toy originated from the Steiff company of Germany in the late 19th century and gained popularity following the creation of the \"Teddy\" bear in the US in 1903, at the same time the German toy inventor Richard Steiff designed a similar bear.<br/>However, the largest somewhat commonly produced stuffed animals are not much bigger than a person.<br/>Stuffed toys most commonly take the form of animals, especially bears (in the case of teddy bears), mammalian pets such as cats and dogs, and highly recognizable animals such as zebras, tigers, pandas, lizards, and elephants.<br/>In 1903, Richard Steiff designed a soft stuffed bear that differed from earlier traditional rag dolls because it was made of plush furlike fabric.<br/><br/><br/>", "concept": "<strong>lose</strong><strong>: </strong>hearing about the game cause to lose it<br/>a fighter does not want to lose<br/>jump at the chance require you to

centre of the dial:.<br/>Occasionally, markings of any sort are dispensed with, and the time is read by the angles of the hands.<br/>The minute hand rotates more slowly around the dial.<br/>Before the late 14th century, a fixed hand (often a carving literally shaped like a hand) indicated the hour by pointing to numbers on a rotating dial.<br/>A long minute hand makes one revolution every hour.<br/>The term is less commonly used for the time display on digital clocks and watches.<br/>Clocks can indicate the hour with Roman numerals or Hindu\u2013Arabic numerals, or with non-numeric indicator marks.<br/>The convention of the hands moving clockwise evolved in imitation of the sundial.<br/>A second type of clock face is the 24-hour analog dial, widely used in military and other organizations that use 24-hour time.<br/>The face may also include a second hand, which makes one revolution per minute.<br/><br/><br/><strong>sleep</strong><strong>: </strong>The internal circadian clock is profoundly influenced by changes in light, since these are its main clues about what time it is.<br/>The use of artificial light has substantially altered humanity's sleep patterns.<br/>The internal circadian clock promotes sleep daily at night.<br/>The circadian rhythm influences the ideal timing of a restorative sleep episode.<br/>Short pulses of light, at the right moment in the circadian cycle, can significantly 'reset' the internal clock.<br/>The balance between sleeping and waking is regulated by a process called homeostasis.<br/>Process C counteracts the homeostatic drive for sleep during the day (in diurnal animals) and augments it at night.<br/>however, people can also reliably wake themselves up at a specific time with no need for an alarm.<br/>Anabolic hormones, such as growth hormones, are secreted preferentially during sleep.<br/>Poor sleep quality disrupts the cycle of transition between the different stages of sleep.<br/><br/><br/><strong>watch tv</strong><strong>: </strong>The series is inspired by the Ankh-Morpork City Watch from the Discworld series of fantasy novels by Terry Pratchett.<br/>It was later reported to be produced by

developed by BBC Studios for BBC America, premiered on 3 January 2021.<br/>it was to have an episodic storyline, following the format of a \"crime of the week\" as tackled by the city's police force under the command of Sam Vimes.<br/>After the October 9th 2020 New York Comic Con panel, Rhianna Pratchett stated it shared \"no DNA with my father's Watch\", and Neil Gaiman compared the series to \"Batman if he's now a news reporter in a yellow trenchcoat with a pet bat\".<br/>On October 30, 2018, BBC America announced that it ordered an eight-episode series of The Watch written by Simon Allen

easy to change the time without removing the watch from the wrist.<br/>Braille watches have analog displays with raised bumps around the face to allow blind users to tell the time.<br/>Their digital equivalents use synthesised speech to speak the time on command.<br/>The device is primarily designed for sight-impaired users, who can use the watch's two ball bearings to determine the time, but it is also suitable for general use.<br/>Customarily, watches provide the time of day, giving at least the hour and minute, and often the second.<br/>Tissot, a Swiss luxury watchmaker, makes the Silen-T wristwatch with a touch-sensitive face that vibrates to help the user to tell time eyes-free.<br/>They speak the time out loud at the press of a button.<br/>Many watches have displays that are

animals.<br/>Animals that are specialized to eat leaves are known as folivores.<br/>Some species have cryptic adaptations by which they use leaves in avoiding predators.<br/>Some sawflies similarly roll the leaves of their food plants into tubes.<br/>A simple leaf has an undivided blade.<br/>The mesophyll tissue inside the leaf, which is rich in chloroplasts (also called chlorenchyma).<br/>Not

have fallen through ice into small ponds or potholes, entombing them.<br/>The ridges were wear-resistant to enable the animal to chew large quantities of food, which often contained grit.<br/>Tusk growth continued throughout life, but became slower as the animal reached adulthood.<br/>The expansion could be used to melt snow if a shortage of water to drink existed, as melting it directly inside the mouth could disturb the thermal balance of the animal.<br/>The woolly mammoth chewed its food by using its powerful jaw muscles to move the mandible forwards and close the mouth, then backwards while opening.<br/>The \"Yukagir mammoth\" had ingested plant matter that contained spores of dung fungus.<br/>The diet of the woolly mammoth was mainly grasses and sedges.<br/>Modern elephants can form large herds, sometimes consisting of multiple family groups, and these herds can include thousands of animals migrating together.<br/>Several specimens have healed bone fractures, showing that the animals had survived these injuries.<br/><br/><br/><strong>flowers</strong><strong>: </strong>Male bees move from one such flower to another in search of a mate.<br/>This fruit is frequently a tool which depends upon animals wishing to eat it, and thus scattering the seeds it contains.<br/>Many plants are dependent upon external factors for pollination, including: wind and animals, and especially insects.<br/>Many flower parts are fused together.<br/>Other flowers use mimicry to attract pollinators.<br/>Some plants make use of abiotic vectors \u2014 namely wind (anemophily) or, much less commonly, water (hydrophily).<br/>The flowers of plants that make use of biotic pollen vectors commonly have glands called nectaries that act as an incentive for animals to visit the flower.<br/>Many perennial and most biennial plants require vernalization to flower.<br/>Birds and bees have color vision, enabling them to seek out \"colorful\" flowers.<br/>Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy).<br/><br/><br/><strong>vegetation</strong><strong>: </strong>Many small aquatic animals use plants such as duckweed for a home, or for protection from

have very specific feeding behaviours, such as hawksbill sea turtles primarily eating sponges.<br/>Several animals are microscopic.<br/>Some animals are capable of asexual reproduction, which often results in a genetic clone of the parent.<br/>Herbivores eat plant material directly, while carnivores, and other animals on higher trophic levels typically acquire it indirectly by eating other animals.<br/>Nearly all animals make use of some form of sexual reproduction.<br/>Several animal phyla lack bilateral symmetry.<br/>With very few exceptions, animals respire aerobically.<br/>All animals are composed of cells, surrounded by a characteristic extracellular matrix composed of collagen and elastic glycoproteins.<br/>All animals are motile (able to spontaneously move their bodies) during at least part of their life cycle, but some animals, such as sponges, corals, mussels, and barnacles, later become sessile.<br/><br/><br/><strong>peanut</strong><strong>: </strong>As animal

call when they are in danger, such as when being attacked by a predator or when a person steps on the log in which one is concealed.<br/>They also eat spiders and can include smaller frogs and even small mammals (including bats) among their prey.<br/>The frog occasionally has small, irregularly shaped white spots on its back.<br/>They are not a rainforest species, but make use of the rain that falls almost daily and collects on leaves and in crevices, to keep themselves moist.<br/><br/><br/><strong>hay</strong><strong>: </strong>Most animals are fed hay in two daily feedings, morning and evening.<br/>Some animals are sensitive to particular fungi or molds that may grow on living plants.<br/>Both types of animals can digest cellulose in grass and hay, but do so by different mechanisms.<br/>Some animals are also fed concentrated feeds such as grain or vitamin supplements in addition to hay.<br/>Different animals also use hay in different ways: cattle evolved to eat forages in relatively large quantities at a single feeding, and then, due to the process of rumination, take a considerable amount of time for their stomachs to digest food, often accomplished while the animal is lying down, at rest.<br/>Some animals, especially those being raised for meat, may be given enough hay that they simply are able to eat all day.<br/>the animal is being kept in a stable or barn.<br/>Other animals, especially those that are ridden or driven as working animals, are only free to eat when not working, and may be given a more limited amount of hay to prevent them from getting too fat.<br/>They require three to four hours per day to eat enough hay to meet their nutritional requirements.<br/>A fence may be built to enclose a haystack and prevent roaming animals from eating it, or animals may feed directly from a field-constructed stack as part of their winter feeding.<br/><br/><br/><strong>grass</strong><strong>: </strong>Many types of animals eat grass as their main source of food, and are called graminivores \u2013 these include cattle, sheep, horses, rabbits and many invertebrates, such as grasshoppers and the caterpillars of many brown butterflies.<br/>Grass, plants growing in the ground.<br/>The evolution of large grazing animals in the Cenozoic contributed to the spread of grasses.<br/>Grasses are also eaten by omnivorous or even occasionally by primarily carnivorous animals.<br/>The leaf blades of many grasses are hardened with silica phytoliths, which discourage grazing animals.<br/>hence, grasses can quickly recover from cropping at the top.<br/>This low growth point evolved in response to grazing animals and allows grasses to be grazed or mown regularly without severe damage to the plant.<br/>Trampling grazers kill seedling trees but not grasses.<br/>Some common aphorisms involve grass.<br/>The smell of the freshly cut grass is produced mainly by cis-3-Hexenal.<br/><br/><br/><strong>elephant</strong><strong>:

for shelter as well as oxygen and food.<br/>Many animals pollinate flowers in exchange for food in the form of pollen or nectar.<br/>Other organisms form mutually beneficial relationships with plants.<br/>Numerous animals have coevolved with plants.<br/>Many animals disperse seeds, often by eating fruit and passing the seeds in their feces.<br/>Humans depend on plants for food, either directly or as feed for domestic animals.<br/>The plant provides a home, and sometimes food, for the ants.<br/>Herbivores eat plants, but plants can defend themselves and some species are parasitic or even carnivorous.<br/>many tropical plants lose their leaves during the dry season.<br/>Some plants reproduce sexually, some asexually, and some via both means.<br/><br/><br/><strong>eat</strong><strong>: </strong>Other animals.<br/>Fungi digest organic matter outside their bodies as opposed to animals that digest their food inside their

time-consuming in a recording.<br/>This degree may result in better patient outcomes.<br/>Nowadays, the NCP is widely used in nursing in various clinical and educational settings as a tool to direct individualized nursing care for clients.<br/>This has been the cause of a great deal of debate in both medical and nursing circles.<br/>Paper-based documentation has been found to be inferior in

formative tissues in the apical openings of the roots of the teeth.<br/>In most tusked species both the males and the females have tusks although the males' are larger.<br/>Elephants use their tusks as digging and boring tools.<br/>They are most commonly canine teeth, as with pigs, hippos, and walruses, or, in the case of elephants, elongated incisors.<br/>Walruses use their tusks to grip on ice and to haul out on ice.<br/>Consequently, many tusk-bearing species have been hunted commercially and several are endangered.<br/>Tusks are elongated, continuously growing front teeth that protrude well beyond the mouth of certain mammal species.<br/>Tusks are used by humans to produce ivory, which is used in artifacts and jewellery, and formerly in other items such as piano keys.<br/>It has been suggested that tusk's structure has evolved to be compatible with extra-oral environments.<br/><br/><br/><strong>the white things</strong><strong>: </strong>The specific computer programs used in

absorb oxygen through their skin.<br/>Pure water is visibly blue due to absorption of light in the region ca.<br/>At higher temperatures and pressures the liquid and vapor phases form a continuous phase called a supercritical fluid.<br/>The principal absorption bands responsible for the color are overtones of the O-H stretching vibrations.<br/>However, even below the boiling point, water can change to vapor at its surface by evaporation (vaporization throughout the liquid is known as boiling).<br/>These meet at a single point called the triple point, where all three phases can coexist.<br/>At the other two corners are lone pairs of valence electrons that do not participate in the bonding.<br/>The study of the distribution of water is hydrography.<br/>The hydrogen atoms are close to two corners of a tetrahedron centered on the oxygen.<br/><br/><br/><strong>ivory</strong><strong>: </strong>Ivory is a hard, white material from the tusks (traditionally elephants') and teeth of animals, that consists mainly of dentine, one of the physical structures of teeth and tusks.<br/>Prior to the introduction of plastics, ivory had many ornamental and practical uses, mainly because of the white color it presents when processed.<br/>Elk also have two ivory teeth, which are believed to be the remnants of tusks from their ancestors.<br/>A species of hard nut is gaining popularity as a replacement for ivory, although its size limits its usability.<br/>Also, Tagua nuts can also be carved like ivory.<br/>Other animals which are now endangered were also preyed upon, for example, hippos, which have very hard white ivory prized for making artificial teeth.<br/>Ivory was often used to form the white of the eyes of statues.<br/>It is sometimes called vegetable ivory, or tagua, and is the seed endosperm of the ivory nut palm commonly found in coastal rainforests of Ecuador, Peru and Colombia.<br/>A type of corn paste called aitiu is used to prepare corn balls, and peanuts are widely used in many dishes.<br/>Chinese craftsmen carved ivory to make everything from images of deities to the pipe stems and end pieces of opium pipes.<br/><br/><br/><strong>trunk</strong><strong>: </strong>The dial tone lines for outgoing calls are called DDCO (Direct Dial Central Office) trunks.<br/>Elephant trunk, the proboscis of an

at the tip of the trunk that allow it to grasp and bring food to its mouth.<br/>The circular feet of an elephant have soft tissues or \"cushion pads\" beneath the manus or pes, which distribute the weight of the animal.<br/>African elephants have larger ears, a concave back, more wrinkled skin, a sloping abdomen, and two finger-like extensions at the tip of the trunk.<br/>The deeper muscles are best seen as numerous distinct fasciculi in a cross-section of the trunk.<br/>It is smoother than that of African elephants, and may be depigmented on the trunk, ears, or neck.<br/>The tusks of an elephant are modified second incisors in the upper jaw.<br/>With its trunk, an elephant can reach items at heights of up to 7 m (23 ft) and dig for water under mud or sand.<br/>these individuals are called \"filsy makhnas\", and are especially common among the Sri Lankan elephant population.<br/>Asian elephants have smaller ears, a convex or level back, smoother skin, a horizontal abdomen that occasionally sags in the middle and one extension at the tip of the trunk.<br/>Perhaps the most well known call is the trumpet which is made by blowing through the trunk.<br/><br/><br/><strong>indian elephant</strong><strong>: </strong>The tip of their trunk has one finger-like process.<br/>In general, Asian elephants are smaller than African elephants and have the highest body point on the head.<br/>Indian elephants have smaller ears, but relatively broader skulls and larger trunks than African elephants.<br/>Unlike their African cousins, their abdomen is proportionate with their body weight but the African elephant has a large abdomen as compared to the skulls.<br/>In 1985, two large elephant bulls were spotted for the first time in Bardia National Park, and named Raja Gaj and Kanchha.<br/>Indian elephants reach a shoulder height of between 2 and 3.<br/>They browse more in the dry season with bark constituting a major part of their diet in the cool part of that season.<br/>Elephants that pass through from one forest patch to another dash against the trains and die.<br/>They graze on the tall grasses, but the portion consumed varies with season.<br/>In Nepal's Bardia National Park, elephants consume large amounts of the floodplain grass, particularly during the monsoon season.<br/><br/><br/><strong>savannah</strong><strong>: </strong>Many grassy landscapes and mixed communities of trees, shrubs, and grasses were described as savanna before the middle of the 19th century, when the concept of a tropical savanna climate became established.<br/>There is evidence that unpalatable woody plants have increased under grazing in savannas.<br/>The removal of trees from savanna land removes the competition for water from the grasses present, and can lead to a two to fourfold increase in pasture production, as well as improving the quality of the feed available.<br/>Sometimes midwestern savanna were described as \"grassland with trees\".<br/>Pine barrens in scattered locations from New Jersey to coastal New England are remnants of these savannas.<br/>It has been suggested by many authors that aboriginal burning created a structurally more open savanna landscape.<br/>It is often believed that savannas feature widely spaced, scattered trees.<br/>Savannas maintain an open canopy despite a high tree density.<br/>In contrast the open structure of savannas allows the growth of a herbaceous layer and are commonly used for grazing domestic livestock.<br/>A number of exotic plants species have been introduced to the savannas around the world.<br/><br/><br/><strong>drink water</strong><strong>: </strong>Globally, by 2015, 89% of people had access to water from a source that is suitable for drinking \u2013 called improved water source.<br/>Soft drinks are called \"soft\" in contrast with \"hard\" alcoholic drinks.<br/>This prevented the marble from blocking the neck as the drink was poured.<br/>Another type of water treatment is called desalination and is used mainly in dry areas with access to large bodies of saltwater.<br/>Drinks like ginger ale and root beer are often brewed using yeast to cause carbonation.<br/>His Codd-neck bottle was designed to enclose a marble and a rubber washer in the neck.<br/>dry ingredients are often sold in pouches, in a style of the popular U.<br/>Bottled water is

age at between five and seven.<br/>In addition, an August 28, 1901 marriage certificate for Sarah Knauss gives her age as 21, which roughly matches with a September 1880 birthday considering that, with such a birthday, she would have been less than one month short of age 21 at this time.<br/>Clark) that gave her age as 19, and that also explicitly gave her year and month of birth as September 1880.<br/>Sarah Knauss is listed (as Sadie Knauss) as age 29 in the 1910 US Census and (as Sarah Knauss) as age 49 in the 1930 US Census (with her 1930 US Census entry listing her age at first marriage as 21, matching the information on her 1901 marriage record)\u2014both of which also imply her birth date was in September 1880.<br/>According to the date of birth her orphanage assigned her,

couple of months short of her 10th birthday at the time of the 1890 US Census in June 1890 (indeed, her age could have simply been rounded up to the next-highest year in this census entry).<br/>Court testimony from Allen's doorman and housekeeper suggested that Allen and Previn began their sexual relationship during Previn's senior year in high school.<br/>The Seoul Family Court established a Family Census Register (legal birth document) on her behalf on December 28, 1976, with a presumptive birth date of October 8, 1970.<br/>Robert Young of the Gerontology Research Group has previously verified Sarah Knauss's claimed age of 119 years and 97 days and concluded that Sarah Knauss was likely the age claimed.<br/><br/><br/><strong>girl</strong><strong>: </strong>It is estimated that each year at least one million children, mostly girls, become prostitutes.<br/>In India, scholars estimate from boy to girl ratio at birth that sex-selective abortions cause a loss of about 1.<br/>Another practice is that of selling girls in exchange of the bride price.<br/>These skills would be taught from generation to generation, with the knowledge passed down orally from mother to daughter.<br/>Puberty is a process that usually takes place between 10 and 16 years, but these ages differ from girl to girl.<br/>In China, scholars report 794 baby girls for every 1000 baby boys in rural regions.<br/>1, Williams revealed that the album's second single would be \"Marilyn Monroe\".<br/>A major threat to girls' health is early marriage, which often leads to early pregnancy.<br/>In Azerbaijan, last 20 years of birth data suggests 862 girls were born for every 1000 boys, on average every year.<br/>Research demonstrates that a girl who has received an education will:.<br/><br/><br/><strong>would</strong><strong>: </strong>If only he would give me a sign.<br/>Modal uses of the preterite form would include:.<br/>I dare say (another idiomatic expression, here exceptionally without negation or question syntax)The modal use of need is close in meaning to must expressing necessity or obligation.<br/>She may have eaten the cake (the speaker does not know whether she ate cake).<br/>I would live there for the next ten years.<br/>She might have eaten cake (this means either the same as the above, or else means that she did not eat cake but that it was or would have been possible for her to eat cake).<br/>for example, he will make mistakes may mean that he frequently makes mistakes (here the word will is usually stressed somewhat, and often expresses annoyance).<br/>Note that most of these so-called preterite forms are most often used in the subjunctive mood in the present tense.<br/>I was thinking a lot about Andrew Wood at the time.<br/>The

example for a definitive estimate might be that the estimate has a -5/+10% range of accuracy with a 90% confidence that the final value will fall in that range.<br/>For example, if one were asked to estimate the percentage of people who like candy, it would clearly be correct that the number falls between zero and one hundred percent.<br/>An example of estimation would be determining how many candies of a given size are in a glass jar.<br/>Such an estimate would provide no guidance, however, to somebody who is trying to determine how many candies to buy for a party to be attended by a hundred people.<br/>the only question is how long will it take.<br/>Generally more contingency is needed for earlier estimates due to the higher uncertainty of estimate accuracy.<br/>The method used for most definitive estimates is to fully define and understand the scope, take off or quantify the scope, and apply costing to the scope, which can then be summed to a total cost.<br/>Early estimates may employ various means of cost modeling.<br/>High-quality cost estimates can be produced by following a rigor of 12 steps outlined by the U.<br/><br/><br/>", "concept": "<strong>her
