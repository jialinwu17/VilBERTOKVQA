for domestic animals.<br/>Most animals rely on the biomass and energy produced by plants through photosynthesis.<br/>Many animals rely on plants for shelter as well as oxygen and food.<br/>They eat a greater variety of plants during the dry season, as fewer plants are available.<br/>A wide variety of plants are poisonous.<br/>The growth rate of plants is extremely variable.<br/>Coffee and cocoa are the common beverages obtained from the flowering plants.<br/><br/><br/><strong>elephant</strong><strong>: </strong>One elephant has been observed to graze by kneeling on its front legs, raising on its hind legs and taking in grass with its lips.<br/><br/><br/><strong>animal</strong><strong>: </strong>Humans depend on plants for food, either directly or as feed for domestic animals.<br/>Most animals are fed hay in two daily feedings, morning and evening.<br/>Most animals rely on the biomass and energy produced by plants through photosynthesis.<br/>Both types of animals can digest cellulose in grass and hay, but do so by different mechanisms.<br/>Some animals, especially those being raised for meat, may be given enough hay that they simply are able to eat all day.<br/>Many animals rely on plants for shelter as well as oxygen and food.<br/>Different animals also use hay in different ways: cattle evolved to eat forages in relatively large quantities at a single feeding, and then, due to the process of rumination, take a considerable amount of time for their stomachs to digest food, often accomplished while the animal is lying down, at rest.<br/>Many animals disperse seeds, often by eating fruit and passing the seeds in their feces.<br/>Many animals pollinate flowers in exchange for food in the form of pollen or nectar.<br/><br/><br/><strong>leaf</strong><strong>: </strong>Other herbivores and their predators mimic the appearance of the leaf.<br/><br/><br/><strong>peanut</strong><strong>: </strong>Crunchy coated peanuts, called kabukim in Hebrew, are a popular snack in Israel.<br/>Dry-roasting peanuts is a common form of preparation.<br/>Meanwhile, the hearts of peanuts are segregated through inspection.<br/>Indian cuisine uses roasted, crushed peanuts to give a crunchy body to salads.<br/>Across East Africa, roasted peanuts, often in cones of newspaper, are obtained from street vendors.<br/><br/><br/>", "image_url":
